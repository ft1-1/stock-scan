MARKETDATA INTEGRATION STATUS SUMMARY
================================================================================

‚úÖ WHAT'S WORKING:
-----------------
1. MarketData API is accessible and responding
2. Options data is being fetched (contracts, strikes, Greeks)
3. Authentication is working with your API key
4. The integration code is calling MarketData (not just EODHD)

‚ö†Ô∏è CURRENT BEHAVIOR:
--------------------
1. Getting LIVE data (status 200) instead of CACHED (status 203)
2. This costs 1 credit PER CONTRACT (46 credits for AAPL)
3. Cached feed would cost only 1 credit total

üìä CREDIT USAGE:
----------------
- Each run with 4 symbols (AAPL, MSFT, GOOGL, TSLA) uses ~200 credits
- With cached feed, this would be only 4 credits
- Check your usage at: https://www.marketdata.app/dashboard

üîß POSSIBLE SOLUTIONS:
----------------------
1. Your account might not have cached feed access
   ‚Üí Check subscription at https://www.marketdata.app/account
   
2. Use more aggressive filtering to reduce contracts:
   ‚Üí Specific strikes instead of date ranges
   ‚Üí Higher minOpenInterest (500+)
   ‚Üí Tighter moneyness filters
   
3. Cache results locally to avoid repeated API calls
   ‚Üí Save options data with timestamp
   ‚Üí Reuse if less than 1 hour old

üìù RECOMMENDATIONS:
-------------------
1. For testing: Use single strike/expiration to minimize credits
2. For production: Consider upgrading for cached feed access
3. Add local caching layer to prevent redundant calls
4. Monitor credit usage closely at the dashboard

The good news: MarketData IS being called and working!
The optimization: Need to reduce credit consumption.

Amkor Technology (NASDAQ:AMKR), which handles advanced packaging, was asked to stop work, while Samsung Electronics (SSNLF), a key supplier of high-bandwidth memory, was also told to pause. Foxconn (FXCOF), involved in backend processing, got the same directive.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 5 Warning Sign with AMKR. Is AMKR fairly valued? Test your thesis with our free DCF calculator.\n\nNvidia downplayed the move, saying it constantly manages its supply chain to reflect market conditions. The company stressed the H20 isn't a military product or meant for government systems, noting China won't rely on U.S. chips for state usejust as Washington wouldn't turn to Chinese chips for its own agencies.\n\nThe pause comes after fresh scrutiny in Beijing. Regulators have reportedly told major players like Tencent, ByteDance, and Alibaba (NYSE:BABA) to suspend H20 orders, flagging national security risks.\n\nFor Nvidia, the development underscores just how tricky the China market has becomeeven as demand for its AI chips elsewhere remains red-hot.\n\nView Comments",

            "content": "Second quarter earnings season is winding down, and with most of the reports in, the results have been mostly positive.\n\nOver 92% of S&P 500 index companies have reported results, and as of Aug. 18, analysts expected S&P 500 companies to report an 11% jump in earnings per share during the second quarter.\n\nCompanies had lower expectations to clear coming into the quarter — analysts expected S&P 500 earnings to rise 5% in Q2, the slowest pace of earnings growth since Q4 2023 — amid President Trump's tariffs, stocks' lofty valuations, and uncertainty about the health of the US economy.\n\nNvidia (NVDA) results on Wednesday, Aug. 27, highlight next week's bout of earnings.\n\nOther companies reporting in the coming week include Alibaba (BABA), Okta (OKTA), Abercrombie & Fitch (ANF), CrowdStrike (CRWD), Five Below (FIVE), HP (HP), Kohl's (KSS), Snowflake (SNOW), J.M. Smucker (SJM), Urban Outfitters (URBN), Affirm (AFRM), Best Buy (BBY), Bath & Body Works (BBWI), Dick's Sporting Goods (DKS), Dell (DELL), Dollar General (DG), Gap (GAP), Petco (WOOF), and Ulta (ULTA).\n\nMeanwhile, markets will continue to digest commentary from Walmart (WMT), Target (TGT), Home Depot (HD), and Lowe's (LOW) this week on the health of the consumer.\n\nHere are the latest updates from corporate America.LIVE272 updates\n\nFeatured\n\nThu, August 21, 2025 at 8:42 PM UTC\n\nGrace O'Donnell\n\nZoom stock pops as CEO attributes earnings beat to AI\n\nZoom stock (ZM) popped 5% on Thursday afternoon after the company reported a huge earnings beat.\n\nZoom posted earnings per share of $1.16, compared to Wall Street analyst estimates for $0.72, per S&P Global Market Intelligence. That represents 66% annual earnings growth.\n\nThe company's founder and CEO, Eric Yuan, noted that the strong quarter comes as artificial intelligence reshapes the way people are working. The company highlighted its paid add-on for custom AI agents that help with meeting prep and call summaries as drivers.\n\nRevenue rose 5% to $1.2 billion, bolstered by 7% growth in Enterprise revenue. The company's monthly churn rate remained flat year over year at 2.9%.\n\nZoom also raised its full-year revenue outlook and free cash flow guidance, which is now expected to be in the range of $1.74 billion to $1.78 billion.\n\nFor the full 2026 fiscal year, total revenue is expected to be between $4.825 billion and $4.835 billion while diluted EPS is expected to be between $5.81 and $5.84.\n\n24 mins ago\n\nGrace O'Donnell\n\nNvidia to highlight next week's earnings\n\nSecond quarter results from Abercrombie & Fitch (ANF), Kohl's (KSS), and Best Buy (BBY) next week will continue to beat the drum of retail earnings after reports from America's big box stores, Walmart (WMT) and Target (TGT).\n\nBut it's Nvidia's (NVDA) earnings that will be the star attraction, as the AI chipmaker's stock has an 8% weighting in the S&P 500 (^GSPC).\n\nAs Yahoo Finance Senior Tech Editor Dan Howley writes, investors will be squarely focused on Nvidia's data center business — even more so since the company announced a new gigascale networking plan that will combine the performance of multiple data centers to create one massive GPU. And many will be eager to hear more about a new China chip Nvidia is developing with the Trump administration.\n\nHere's a look at next week's earnings calendar, marking a sort of grand finale for the second quarter reporting season:\n\nMonday: PDD Holdings(PDD)\n\nTuesday: BMO (BMO), MongoDB (MDB), Okta (OKTA), PVH (PVH)\n\nWednesday: Nvidia (NVDA), Abercrombie & Fitch, CrowdStrike (CRWD), Five Below (FIVE), HP (HP), Kohl's, Pure Storage (PSTG), Snowflake (SNOW), The J.M.

Today at 12:07 PM UTC\n\nGrace O'Donnell\n\nBJ's Wholesale Club stock falls as fuel prices weigh on sales\n\nFuel prices weighed on BJ's Wholesale Club (BJ) sales in the second quarter, the company reported Friday.\n\nOverall comparable club sales decreased by 0.3% year over year, while comparable sales excluding gasoline increased by 2.3% annually.\n\nThe company reported earnings per share of $1.14, topping Wall Street's estimates for earnings of $1.09 per share. Revenue of $5.38 billion in the quarter disappointed expectations for $5.48 billion, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence\n\nBJ's reiterated its full-year revenue guidance and narrowed the range for its earnings outlook. For fiscal 2025, BJ's sees comparable club sales minus gasoline increasing 2% to 3.5% year-over-year.

Thu, August 21, 2025 at 8:26 PM UTC\n\nGrace O'Donnell\n\nWorkday to acquire AI company Paradox, stock falls\n\nWorkday (WDAY) stock slipped more than 3% in after-hours trading following the company's announcement that it would acquire Paradox for an undisclosed amount. Paradox is an AI company that uses AI chatbots to simplify the job application process.\n\nWorkday also reported second quarter results that beat expectations. Subscription revenue increased 14%, lifting overall revenue to $2.35 billion in the second quarter. Wall Street was looking for revenue of $2.34 billion.\n\nDiluted earnings per share of $2.21 beat estimates of $2.12 per share.\n\n\"Our second quarter results reflect the strength of our platform and our continued progress across several of our growth initiatives,\" CFO Zane Rowe said. \"Following our first half momentum — and also incorporating the acquisition of Paradox — we are increasing our fiscal 2026 subscription revenue guidance to $8.815 billion, representing growth of 14%, and increasing our fiscal 2026 non-GAAP operating margin guidance to approximately 29%.\" Thu, August 21, 2025 at 8:15 PM UTC\n\nGrace O'Donnell\n\nIntuit forecasts first-quarter revenue growth below estimates\n\nShares of Intuit (INTU), the company behind tax-preparation and finance software TurboTax, Credit Karma, and QuickBooks, fell 5% after hours after the company forecast fiscal first quarter revenue growth below analyst estimates.\n\nReuters reports:\n\nIntuit's board also approved a new $3.2 billion share buyback plan, raising its total repurchase authorization to $5.3 billion.\n\nRead more here.

Wall Street analysts were expecting earnings per share of $3.64 on revenue of $2.85 billion.\n\nAfter a sluggish spring season in the housing market, there have been signs of a resurgence, with housing starts jumping in July.

Analysts had expected orders growth.\n\n\"The average sales price of new contracts was $1.0 million, up 4.5% year-over-year,\" CEO Douglas Yearley said in the earnings release. \"Contract dollars were flat despite a 4% decline in units. While affordability pressures and uncertain economic conditions persist, we are pleased with the resilience of our luxury business and more affluent customer base.\" Tue, August 19, 2025 at 8:32 PM UTC\n\nGrace O'Donnell\n\nLa-Z-Boy stock drops on soft earnings and guidance\n\nLa-Z-Boy stock (LZB) dropped 16% in after-hours trading after the company missed earnings estimates and navigated \"soft industry demand.\"\n\nOverall, comparable sales dropped 1% to $492 million from a year ago. Sales in the furniture retailer's wholesale segment increased 1%, and retail sales rose 5%, but they were offset by weakness in the Joybird brand, which saw sales decline 14%.\n\nLa-Z-Boy reported diluted earnings per share of $0.44, compared to $0.61 per share a year ago. The Street was looking for earnings of $0.52 per share.\n\nLa-Z-Boy's guidance also came in lighter than expected. It expects sales in the range of $510 million to $530 million in the fiscal second quarter. Wall Street was looking for $532 million, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence.

            "title": "Ahead of the Alibaba Smart Car Spinoff, How Should You Play BABA Stock?",
            "content": "Alibaba Group (BABA) is a Chinese multinational technology company that specializes in e-commerce, retail, and cloud computing. The company operates leading marketplaces including Taobao (C2C), Tmall (B2C), and Alibaba.com (B2B). Alibaba has evolved into a diversified tech giant with strong investments in artificial intelligence (AI), digital media, logistics through its Cainiao network, and fintech via Ant Group. After years of regulatory and market uncertainty, Alibaba has finally been making a comeback.\n\nFounded in 1999, the company is headquartered in Hangzhou, China.\n\nMore News from Barchart\n\nShould You Buy the Dip as Palantir Stock Falls for 7 Straight Days? George Soros Is Betting Big on Beaten-Down UnitedHealth Stock. Should You? 2 ‘Strong Buy’ Stocks Offering Fat Yields of Over 7.5% in August 2025 Markets move fast. Keep up by reading our FREE midday Barchart Brief newsletter for exclusive charts, analysis, and headlines.\n\nAbout BABA Stock\n\nBABA stock has shown plenty of volatility this year, with a couple of major movements. The stock is up over 45% year-to-date, outpacing the illustrious S&P 500’s ($SPX) 9% increase. Despite the solid gains, the stock has been trading flat since April, with only a 2% gain in a month and 1.2% in a quarter. Overall, Alibaba still has room to grow, with the stock being 17% below its 52-week-high set in March this year.www.barchart.com\n\nAlibaba Posts Mixed Results\n\nAlibaba Group reported its second quarter 2025 financial results with adjusted earnings per share of $2.15, slightly below the prior year and analyst estimates, reflecting a minor 4% decline year-over-year (YOY). Revenue for the quarter rose 5% YOY to $33.7 billion, beating expectations and driven largely by growth in the Cloud Intelligence Group and international e-commerce segments.\n\nOther key financial metrics included a 58% surge in net income to $6.25 billion and strong performance in Alibaba Cloud, which grew 7% in revenue with an 89% jump in adjusted EBITDA, fueled by AI product adoption. However, segments like Cainiao logistics and Alibaba International Digital Commerce showed profitability pressures.\n\nLooking ahead, Alibaba remains focused on accelerating its AI and cloud investments, committing $53 billion over three years to AI infrastructure. Management expects continued growth from AI-powered services and expanding international markets but cautions about regulatory risks and geopolitical uncertainties in 2025 affecting margins and overall profitability.\n\nAlibaba-Backed Company Eyes IPO\n\nAlibaba-backed Banma, a Shanghai-based technology provider specializing in smart cockpit solutions for vehicles, is preparing to potentially list its shares on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, according to a recent filing dated Aug. 21. Alibaba currently holds about 45% ownership in Banma and plans to retain control of over 30% following the proposed listing. However, the filing also cautions that this announcement does not guarantee that the listing will definitely occur.\n\nStory Continues\n\nFounded in 2015, Banma develops innovative smart cockpit solutions that integrate artificial intelligence into automotive systems. In March, Alibaba announced that it was deepening its collaboration with BMW (BMWKY) in China by developing an AI engine for cars, built using Banma’s intelligent cockpit technology. The venture underscores Alibaba’s strategic focus on integrating AI and digital technologies within the automotive sector.\n\nBesides Alibaba, Banma’s investors include prominent Chinese firms such as SAIC Motor, SDIC Investment Management, and Yunfeng Capital, the latter being an investment company established by Alibaba co-founder Jack Ma.\n\nAlibaba has previously described Banma as a joint venture formed between itself and SAIC Motor, highlighting the close partnership aimed at advancing connected car technologies in China’s expanding smart vehicle market. The potential public listing is a significant step for Banma as it aims to accelerate growth and innovation in the smart car technology space.\n\nShould you buy Alibaba?\n\nAnalysts have a soft spot for the e-commerce giant, with a consensus “Buy” rating alongside a mean price target of $157.91, reflecting an upside potential of 28% from the market trading rate.\n\nThe stock has been studied by 22 analysts in total and has received 19 “Strong Buy” ratings, one “Moderate Buy” rating, 1one “Hold” rating, and one “Sell” rating.www.barchart.com\n\nOn the date of publication, Ruchi Gupta did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

Reference actual numbers in your reasoning.\n\n3. **Consistency**: Apply the same scoring standards regardless of the stock. A score of 85 should represent the same quality level across all analyses.\n\n4. **Risk Focus**: Pay special attention to red flags that could invalidate the opportunity (poor liquidity, imminent earnings, deteriorating fundamentals).\n\n5. **Strategy Alignment**: Consider how well this opportunity fits options strategies (directional bias, volatility conditions, time decay considerations).\n\n6. **Completeness Check**: If critical data is missing, note it in your analysis but don't penalize the opportunity excessively for data gaps.\n\nAnalyze the BABA opportunity now using this framework and respond with the required JSON format.",

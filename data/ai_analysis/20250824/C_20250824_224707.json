            "content": "NEW YORK - Citibank, N.A. (NYSE: C), currently trading near its 52-week high at $95.26 and commanding a market capitalization of $175.42 billion, announced it will redeem $2.5 billion in notes on August 29, 2025, as part of its ongoing liability management strategy.\n\nThe redemption includes $1.75 billion of 5.864% fixed rate notes due 2025 and $750 million of floating rate notes due 2025. According to the bank’s statement, the redemption price will equal par value plus accrued and unpaid interest up to, but excluding, the redemption date. InvestingPro data shows Citibank maintains a P/E ratio of 13.89 and offers a dividend yield of 2.59%.\n\nThe bank indicated that this action aligns with its efforts to enhance funding and capital structure efficiency. Citibank stated it will continue evaluating opportunities to redeem or repurchase securities based on economic value, regulatory changes, potential impact on net interest margin and borrowing costs, remaining debt portfolio tenor, capital impact, and market conditions.\n\nInterest on the notes will cease to accrue beginning on the redemption date, with Citibank serving as the paying agent for the notes.\n\nThe announcement comes as part of Citibank’s broader financial management approach. Citi operates in more than 180 countries and jurisdictions, providing financial products and services to corporations, governments, investors, institutions, and individuals. With annual revenue of $72.83 billion and a remarkable 57.95% return over the past year, Citi continues to demonstrate strong market performance. For detailed analysis and 12 additional exclusive insights, visit InvestingPro.\n\nThis information is based on a press release statement issued by Citibank, N.A.\n\nIn other recent news, Citigroup has been exploring stablecoin custody services as part of its expansion into cryptocurrency, following legislative changes in Washington. This move aligns Citigroup with other traditional financial institutions like Bank of America and Fiserv that are considering similar ventures. In a separate development, Bloomberg reported that Citigroup managed over $1 billion in transactions for a Delaware-based trust linked to sanctioned Russian oligarch Suleiman Kerimov. Despite the sanctions imposed by the U.S. Treasury Department in 2018, Citigroup reportedly continued to oversee significant transactions for the trust. Additionally, Citigroup has appointed Aashish Dhakad to lead its private credit origination division in North America, aiming to bolster its presence in the private credit market. Dhakad brings extensive experience from his previous roles at Ares Management and Bank of America. Furthermore, Fitch Ratings has affirmed Citigroup’s long-term and short-term issuer default ratings at ’A’ and ’F1’, maintaining a stable outlook. These developments highlight Citigroup’s strategic initiatives and ongoing operations in various financial sectors.\n\nThis article was generated with the support of AI and reviewed by an editor.

            "content": "What Happened?\n\nA number of stocks jumped in the afternoon session after the major indices rebounded, as Fed Chair Jerome Powell delivered dovish remarks at the much-awaited Jackson Hole symposium. Powell suggested that with inflation risks moderating and unemployment remaining low, the Federal Reserve might consider a shift in its monetary policy stance, including potential interest rate cuts. This outlook eased market concerns about prolonged high interest rates and their impact on economic growth. The prospect of lower borrowing costs bolstered investor confidence, particularly in sectors that have lagged, leading to a broad rally across the market.\n\nThe stock market overreacts to news, and big price drops can present good opportunities to buy high-quality stocks.\n\nAmong others, the following stocks were impacted:\n\nThrifts & Mortgage Finance company WaFd Bank (NASDAQ:WAFD) jumped 4.1%.

Is now the time to buy Crocs? Access our full analysis report here, it’s free.\n\nZooming In On WaFd Bank (WAFD)\n\nWaFd Bank’s shares are not very volatile and have only had 9 moves greater than 5% over the last year. In that context, today’s move indicates the market considers this news meaningful, although it might not be something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business.\n\nWaFd Bank is down 0.9% since the beginning of the year, and at $31.69 per share, it is trading 16.7% below its 52-week high of $38.06 from November 2024. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of WaFd Bank’s shares 5 years ago would now be looking at an investment worth $1,290.\n\nUnless you’ve been living under a rock, it should be obvious by now that generative AI is going to have a huge impact on how large corporations do business.

The deal is expected to close in the early fourth quarter this year. — CNBC's Alex Harring, Michelle Fox Theobald, Sean Conlon, Fred Imbert and Scott Schnipper contributed reporting.",

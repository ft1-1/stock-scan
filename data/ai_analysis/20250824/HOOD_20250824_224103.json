            "content": "US stocks (^DJI, ^GSPC, ^IXIC) ended Friday's session higher, with bitcoin (BTC-USD) and ethereum (ETH-USD) also seeing significant gains. Crypto-related stocks, like Robinhood (HOOD), Coinbase (COIN), and Strategy (MSTR), and high volatility names like Opendoor (OPEN) saw price jumps.\n\nYahoo Finance Senior Reporter Allie Canal outlines what investors need to know about the market rally following Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's Jackson Hole remarks.\n\nTo watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Market Domination.\n\nVideo Transcript\n\n00:00:00 Speaker A\n\nStocks ripping higher to close out the week after Fed chair Jerome Powell open the door to a September rate cut at Jackson Hole. Powell saying, quote, the baseline outlook and the shifting balance of risks may warrant adjusting our policy stance. That fueled bets that the Fed could ease as soon as next month. Markets took that as a green light for risk. Meme darling, Open Door that jumped more than 30%, Ethereum spiked 13% outpacing a 4% gain in Bitcoin. And the enthusiasm spilled into some of those crypto linked names as well. Coinbase gained around 7%, Robin Hood up 4%, strategy up 6%. And this marks a sharp rebound after a pretty rough stretch for some of those high volatility plays. City strategist Scott Croner called the market reaction, quote, very positive, highlighting that a striking surge in small caps along with the equal weighted S&P 500 leading the headline index, it's really all incongruent a sign that the rally may be broadening beyond just Big Tech. Still Croner caution that there was some junkiness as unprofitable growth names also surge, but just really an overall risk on rally here amid Powell's dovish tilt. The question, of course now is whether this proves durable. Here's some of the reaction that we heard today following that speech.\n\n00:02:16 Speaker B\n\nI think he laid out the options in front of us by and not commit to anything. This is important. I know the markets think that he's committed, but I think at this point, there's a lot of uncertainty. I know that word's being used a lot, but the signals are mixed.\n\n00:03:02 Speaker C\n\nWhat Powell was trying to do today was to open the door to a rate cut in September. And what that does is that gives him a little bit insulation because if we get a really bad jobs report next month in early September, he can say, look, I opened the door to a move. Don't worry, we're on it. It's coming.\n\n00:03:53 Speaker D\n\nIn a way, maybe he's auditioning for the role of Fed chair. You know, if you look at the text of the speech, he actually completely removed the phrase that has characterized his entire term as Fed share of data dependent. Uh that wasn't in the speech and he's talking more about the balance of risks, looking ahead, and it was actually kind of refreshing to hear that.\n\n00:04:45 Speaker A\n\nNow, there is going to be a fair amount of data that will be released prior to this September decision. As you just heard, there's still some uncertainty related to the inflation side of the Fed's dual mandate. So we'll have to wait and see, but right now, market's clearly interpreting this as a rate cut in September, Josh.\n\n00:05:19 Josh\n\nAll right, Alex. Now, thank you.

I'm your host, Joe Pompeiano, and I'm here to coach you through the financial game. Today we've got JB McKenzie, the vice president and general manager of Futures and International at Robin Hood, joining the show to discuss the company's launch of its new pro and college call prediction market. Let's huddle up and get right into it.We are kicking off this week with PO's Playbook, where I take a look at some of the biggest headlines in sports that you and your portfolio need to know. First, Kendall Baker of Yahoo Sports reported earlier this week that new MOB media rights deals are close to being done, according to his trusted sources. Baker is hearing that Apple TV is out, while NBC is in talks for exclusive Friday night and Sunday Night Baseball.Games, as well as the wildcard round of the playoffs. The report also said that MLB is set to sell its MLB TV out of market subscription service to ESPN, and Netflix is in line to buy the rights of the home run derby. However, no deals have been finalized. Continuing on with more MLB news, Sports Business Journal reported on Tuesday that Music City Baseball, an organizationTo bring an MLB team to Nashville is prepared to welcome a new expansion team to the Tennessee City. Although the expansion process is still years away, MLB commissioner Rob Mannford has said before that he wants to decide on two expansive cities by his planned retirement in 2029. And according to Sports Business Journal, Nashville is considered to be a strong candidate for expansion when the time comes.Next up, Front Office Sports reported earlier this week that the WNBA has already broken its regular season attendance record with a little less than a month still left to play in the 2025 season. The W has already drawn over 2.4 million fans this season, breaking the previous attendance record of 2.36 million fans for the 2002 regular season. What's remarkable is that the Indiana Fever led the league with over 300,000 fans attending their 18 home games in 2025. Despite superstar Caitlin Clark.Having played in only 8 of those home matchups due to injury, and last up, the NFL and Microsoft announced a multi-year extension on Wednesday that will bring Microsoft co-pilot and the company's AI technologies to NFL club operations. As part of the extension, all 32 NFL teams will be equipped with custom Microsoft Surface tablets starting this season, enabling players and coaches to use co-pilot's AI technology to help analyze real-time data and make faster decisions on the sideline during games.And AI is not only disrupting the NFL, it's also changing the fan experience through broadcast, analytics, and cryptotechnology. NBA champion Tristan Thompson not only helped the Cleveland Cavaliers win their first title in 2016, but now he's the co-founder of an AI platform called Tracy AI. He spoke to financial freestyle host Ross Mack about how AI is changing the way fans and pros experience basketball.\n\n2:46 spk_1\n\nYou said this year, correct me if I'm wrong, you said.When it comes to crypto, right, if you was to explain it to somebody, you say Michael Jordan is Bitcoin, Bron is Ethereum, Steph Curry is XRP, and KD is Solana. Break that down for me, bro.\n\n3:03 spk_2\n\nThe reason why I'm in this space that I've really gravitate toward the space is because there's that bridge the gap moment, right? And I think even in, even in sports, I always like to correlate stuff to sports, right? There's a point in time in your career, you go from being, you know, the, the, the, the top three options to now you get to your later years and you become kind of the veteran voice and you become the bridge the gap between the coaches and the players, right? You know what.Sports, when you have young, the, the, the, the game is getting younger, right? So and the coaches are getting older. So you need that guy in the middle to bridge the gap between the two, and it's no different than in crypto, right? So for me, whenever I'm explaining stuff, I always like to use the knowledge that people can understand and grasp, right? At the end of the day, Bitcoin is like the OG, right? It's the first ever digital aspect. It's the one that has the biggest backing. It's the one that everyone knows.So I use Michael Jordan as an example, right? The guy that kind of revolutionized the NBA and take the NBA from being a $100 million dollar business to being a billion dollar business, right? So that's why I use him as, as Bitcoin. Bron used him as Ethereum because he's, you know, in my eyes I use Brown's to go to mys, but just out of paying respect for the older people, I said Browns with Ethereum, right? He's the next best thing.And then XRP I use a Steph Curry because it's, he's just as great and he has such a huge market cap and Americans love him, which Americans love XRP. So I just use it as my example and then obviously Solano KD where people can understand the tiers, right? So, I just alwaysLike when I'm educating people about 3 and crypto to be able to dump it into a scenario where they can grasp. So Tri,\n\n4:32 spk_1\n\nyou already know, man. I'm gonna have to go ahead and get a little lightning around so you catch you off guard all the way, right? You need a bucket right now. You need a bucket. 10 seconds. Who should have the ball? Is it Kyrie or Bron?\n\n4:43 spk_2\n\nKyle Kyrie, it's fast, right? You want me to ask quick? Kyrie, you can find those game set to step back.\n\n4:50 spk_1\n\nHe was the savior that year. That that's a factory. Alright, Bitcoin and Ethereum.\n\n4:54 spk_2\n\nBitcoin.Jordan or Bron, come on now. You already talk to me nice when you say this. Come on now.\n\n5:02 spk_1\n\nAll right, I see behind you, you got Mohammad. So Mohamed of Floyd,\n\n5:06 spk_2\n\ncome on, Ali, Ali, the\n\n5:08 spk_1\n\ngreatest. And then the next one, obviously you're from Canada, so I need to know if this is a Canada team.UK rap\n\n5:15 spk_2\n\nor American rap? American rap. I know, I know the boy, I know Jersey was saying UK rap, but I, I just kind of agree with that he's American rap all the way to culture. You don't know\n\n5:24 spk_1\n\nthat, that was, that was honestly egregious. I won't, I won't hold that against him though. Uh, and then lastly, AI for blockchain. You had your last dollar and you had to invest it in AI technology or blockchain, which one is it gonna be?\n\n5:38 spk_2\n\nYou seewhat Mark Zuckerberg's paying for all these AI gurus, so I might go AI\n\n5:43 spk_1\n\nnow that we\n\n5:44 spk_2\n\ntalk.\n\n5:44 spk_1\n\nsports, right? I actually tip my hat to you because you're doing something remarkable, right? The intersection of sports, blockchain, and AI. You gotta talk to us about Tracy AI. Let the people know what Tracy AI is and more importantly, what you think the vision for it is.\n\n6:01 spk_2\n\nSo, Tracy AI is basically an AI agent that I created, which is basically imagine a sports analyst or commentator on steroids. What I mean by that is that having all the high-level analytics that you cannot get from NBA.Dotcom and ESPN, which the analytics are coming from the professional teams like, you know, we have certain data and access to certain companies that only professional sports teams have access to, and I was able to be able to pull that data with my resources and be able to put into the AI agent. The reason why I did that is because I noticed that AI is taking over so many sectors, whether it's the music industry, which is obviously causing crazy controversy with AI, whether it's in art and digital and digital art, whether it's um.People trying to find jobs. If you look right now, Amazon is using AI agents to see who qualifies for jobs. Um, I'll give you another example. A law firm, a very prestigious law firm here in California has actually hired and created an AI agent to be basically, they're the bookkeeper and they're basically automated.Assistant like front desk, front desk girl, where they basically answer the call, have full conversations, take books, bookings, meetings, and really almost substituting that front desk girl and making it in the AI agent. So for me, it's like if it's covering so many sectors, how come it hasn't got into sports andFor me, it was like, OK, this is low hanging fruit, and this is an opportunity where I can be a visionary and a pioneer, because at the end of the day, from my upbringing being from Toronto and make it to the NBA, I had to grind for my success, and it's no different now. It's, I've always had this grind buildup mentality, so it just, it migrated so easily into the web 3 and, you know, if you look at Darryl Morey, he'sSaid he used uh AI just to curate his Sixers roster. Mind you, the, the record wasn't great, injuries and so on, but that just shows you that's the first domino effect and something great.\n\n7:52 spk_1\n\nThat's epic, right? I, I think, you know, not only is it commentator, but it sounds as though you can also be able to leverage it, uh, for the, the sports gambling, uh, world at some point. They might not just have to pay the, the Jonta Porters of the world. They might be able to, you know, do it on the up and up.\n\n8:10 spk_0\n\nYou can listen to the full financial freestyle interview with Tristan Thompson wherever you get your podcast. Now, we're going to take a quick break, but when we come back, with college football kicking off this weekend in the NFL less than 2 weeks away, a popular trading app is now letting you bet on the game just like the stock market. We'll explain more coming right up.Welcome back to Yahoo Finance Sports Report. I'm your host, Joe Pompeano. We've made it to the one on one, a conversation ready to break down news and sports with a key player in the industry. This week, we're speaking to JB McKenzie, the vice president and general manager of Futures International, Robin Hood. JB, thank you so much for joining the show.Today, I specifically want to talk about these prediction markets that you guys have launched more recently and more widely what's going on in the industry in a whole. So if you could just start with a simple explainer of sort of what sports prediction markets are for people who may not be familiar, and then why Robin Hood is interested in offering these trades.\n\n9:12 spk_3\n\nWell, first, Joe, thanks a lot for having me on, uh, long time listener, glad that I can finally participate. Um, but yeah, I mean, when we're looking at these prediction markets, they really have started to explode into the, the retail investment world, and what they are is basically a probability, right? You're looking at what is the probability of an event to occur.So, for example, the one that got the most news was about a year ago for the presidential election contracts, and that was who was gonna win uh the president? Was it going to be Vice President Harris or potentially former President Trump. And obviously we saw this tremendous interest that came into play, um, for people participating on those probabilities of that event coming true. What's happened since then is you've seen this evolution into other markets, whether it'sEconomic markets such as price volatility will, let's say the price of Bitcoin go above or below something. But more importantly, I think you've seen is moved into the sports world, and I think what you're seeing is that more and more people are interested in using these probabilities in their overall uh portfolios because it gives them a chance to trade in real time what's happening for something, let's say like pro football, college football, or other things like even like the US Open here in New York.\n\n10:24 spk_0\n\nYeah, and, and when you think about uh the differences between production markets and traditional sports betting, how do you typically explain that to the average sports fan who may only be associated with sports betting in general?\n\n10:36 spk_3\n\nWell, there's a couple key differences. The first one is with sort of traditional sports betting, uh, platforms, they actually make the odds or make the markets, right? So they're actually putting them out there, and they actually differ between different platforms you're there, that you utilize. When you go to something like our prediction markets, first of all, it's buyers and sellers. There's people like you and me, Joe, that are coming in.And putting in um where we believe that market should be, and then what happens is it starts to evolve from there. It works like traditional markets like the uh equities, the options or futures markets where buyers and sellers come together to actually create what is the actual true price that they believe that market should be. The other area that it's different in is that it actually gives you the ability to exit.So, in traditional uh platforms, you can't exit or you have to do at a tremendous loss that goes to that specific platform. In these markets, because they are transparent and they're centralized, you can go in and out of that market at any time. So let's say you make a, you, you pick a a contract and it's moving in your favor, but you don't want to hold onto it any longer, you actually can close out of it without having a penalty, and vice versa if it goes below you. And then I think the final thing I would say that's really the difference between um these prediction markets andThe traditional sports marketplace is that you actually can trade them during the event itself. So, as the event is going on and the markets are moving, you actually can trade in and out of them, so that you can, you know, again, exit as the market's moving with what's happening in that market in real time. You don't have to wait for the event to end for you to find out whether or not you perhaps made or lost money.\n\n12:11 spk_0\n\nYeah, and we were talking a little bit before this about just how some of the traditional sports betting players are potentially making moves toward the prediction markets as well and adding that as an offering within their wider offering in total. And for people who are listening that maybe aren't as familiar, there's a different uh regulation process for prediction markets for sports betting. If you're in sports betting, you obviously have to go state by state. Uh, some of these states have a specific number of licenses with high tax rates, whatever. It's a little bit quicker on the prediction market side depending on how you look at it, butThey're traditional players in sports betting, uh, I think objectively you could probably say have felt threatened by this. Uh, there is some level of, uh, lobbying and uh there's been lawsuits and other things like that. Some have been successful, some have not, but it's clearly moving in this direction where people are, uh, customers are telling companies that they're interested in this level of product. I'm sure you guys have seen that. But long term, where do you think this, this plays out? Where do we end up here between traditional sports betting versus prediction markets?\n\n13:05 spk_3\n\nWell, I think that I mean right now you're you're watching, as you said, sort of the beginning of it, as they come together and we're trying to decide what this, what the end result's gonna be.I think what is really telling to me is that uh you're watching those traditional uh betting platforms come into this prediction market space. So you have partnerships that have been announced CME and FanDuel yesterday announced a partnership. You've had DraftKings looking to acquire a uh what they call a DCM which is a a a a designated contract market which is known as sort of, uh, like the futures market and the swap marketplace. You're seeing them move.In there you're seeing ie markets acquiring. So people are moving into the space very, very quickly from that traditional space. I think what you're going to continue to see is that when you have federally regulated markets that are about done like it is on the futures and swaps world in our prediction markets, it makes it incredibly transparent to the end user. It's consistent pricing for them, no matter where they're located. Pricing is also very, very transparent as well. So I think end users are going to be the realWinner here because they're gonna be able to see financial rigor come into these markets that in many ways are bifurcated. Um, it's going to take time for it to play out, but clearly what's happening is our customers are incredibly interested in doing it. Um, they're participating at increasing rates quarter over quarter, and I think you're going to see that continue to evolve here or continue that trend to move forward, um, as more and more product comes to market and more platforms continue to offer these products.\n\n14:30 spk_0\n\nYeah, and if we were to zoom out for a second, it sort of feels like to me that that Robin Hood, uh, if we just look at and and I'd love to get your insight and just kind of like the product roadmap and how you guys think about the business overall, right? Because it sort of feels like you guys are creating uh one stop shop for like everything financial someone needs to do for an entire new generation of people, right? There is saving, investing, spending, predicting. Is that sort of the plan, it's just to put like everything that someone could possibly want to do from a financial perspective within one app.\n\n14:59 spk_3\n\nYeah, I think our goal, and I think it leads from our CEO VAD, which is we want to create the home for any financial instrument that you want to invest, that you want to trade, or you wanna hold in your portfolio, and make it very easy and simple for you to access it. And I think if you look at whom Robin has been over its career, it has been an innovative company that has totally focused itself on actually breaking down.Barriers and make it easier for people to participate in those markets. When you look at what we're doing here with the prediction markets, I think this is just another example. We're one of the first firms to come through the door. We think that there's a way for us to continue to work with our clients on how to build a better uh platform for them. We take their feedback and we listen to what they're talking about or what they want to trade. And I think you've seen that where we started off with election contracts, we moved into sports. We canContinue to add a variety of sports products, but we haven't stopped there. We've also looked at economic indicators, things such as what happens with inflation rates, what happens with the price movement of certain assets. We want to find ways where people can use this information as not only uh a sort of a data point for them to look at for their overall investments. Let's see what happens with what socially people are looking at in that marketplace and what their belief is. Couple that with someYou know, traditional, say, institutional data points, and then you can make a more, a more educated and more calculated investment as a trader. So I really think more than anything else, you're gonna see this turn into the opportunity for you to collect your information, make good decisions, then access markets that perhaps maybe you can't get at other traditional brokerage firms.\n\n16:27 spk_0\n\nAre you able to give us any numbers? Like, uh, uh, some of this is obviously public, right? You can go on Robin Hood, you look at the prediction markets, you could see the total volume, but just when we like zoom out for a second and look at the totality of what you guys have accomplished in the prediction market so far, are there any numbers or data points that stick out to you to show that this is really working and this is something that customers really want?\n\n16:47 spk_3\n\nAbsolutely. I think, look, we've had over 750,000 people participate in these markets since we started offering them back in, uh, November of last year. We've traded over 2 billion contracts. And in the last quarter alone, we've seen over a billion contracts traded as well. So the fact of the matter is, is that the the our clients.are incredibly interested and intrigued with it. I think more than anything else, they're looking for additional products to come out the door, meaning they want to see us offer more and what we're trying to do is figure out what is that right product because what we do is we want to look at the overall marketplace and then decide what makes the most sense for us to offer. And so what we've seen is with football is a great example is we had a very strong client demand.We've built a product for them and now we're distributing it out to them. And so I think what you'll continue to see is the addition of product and more and more people coming through. I think we're at the beginning of a really transformational point for prediction markets and the participation for investors, uh, both retail, um, institutional, and beyond. I think this is a really exciting time to be in that prediction market space.\n\n17:48 spk_0\n\nSo I would love to talk a little bit more about that actually, because one of the questions I had is how you actually come up with the markets that you're gonna be offering, right? I see some of these prediction markets, uh, they have the obvious stuff, right? Who's gonna win the Super Bowl, who's gonna win this game, whatever it might be, but then they have some other things that are like social media trends that maybe don't have as much volume, uh, that are just more fun.Gimmicky. Is there like a, I assume there's sort of a detailed process to go into finding out kind of which prediction markets you want to offer, but then is it, uh, is it at the point where it's like the more the merrier, it's not super expensive to want individual ones if we're going to do them anyway, so we just do more than we need? Like how do you think about that process of determining which ones actually go to market?\n\n18:27 spk_3\n\nWell that that that's a great question, Joe, and we actually use this as the sort of the same criteria, I'll tell you at this sort of high level. I can't give you all the secret sauce, but I can give you a little bit of the details of what we do.Um, is really what we do is we kind of look around the marketplace as a whole and we see what products or what, uh, what's trending and where do we have our our clients. Clients also write into us or or or comment into us on a regular basis of what they're interested in potentially trading. So we kind of have a wide net that we're looking at. Then what we do from there is we look a little bit and say, OK, what's the volume of the open interest because we want to make sure that a product that we provide out there has the appropriate liquidity for.Someone to participate in. And so as we look at those products, we start to then watch them and we track them, and then as they get closer and closer and we see a combination of client demand and um interest and liquidity, we'll then bring that product to market. We do that very similarly with other asset classes that I that I lead, such as the futures markets, but we do watch overall, and I think what's been interesting to your point is we've seen a trend of it continuing to develop. And look, we, we've done.You know, elections, we have done, uh, sports, um, we just went into the social uh marketplace for the first time offering the prediction on the Emmy, uh, Emmys, um, so we do see that this interest is really starting to expand, and we also see it happening much more in the economic, uh, world as well. I mean, look, you've got people out in in Jackson Hole talking about what's going to happen within.Interest rates and you see at the top of mind for people. So I really think what we try to do is figure out what is the breadth of product, bring it in there, but we also want to make sure it's in, it fits within our overall ecosystem. So it's an easy way for people to access it through the platform. We just don't want to pile a bunch of of contracts in there without people having the ability to easily access them so what what they're looking for, they can get to very quickly.\n\n20:08 spk_0\n\nYeah, it feels like it's sort of like you want to give enough, but you don't want too much in distracting people, but JB, it's been awesome to see you guys enter a new market and just have so much success, uh, so quickly. So thank you so much for joining us today.\n\n20:20 spk_3\n\nI appreciate you having me on. I'm looking forward to coming back again real soon.\n\n20:24 spk_0\n\nThe clock is winding down here, but we have just enough time for some final buzz. The US Open kicked off earlier this week in New York, and ahead of the last Grand Slam on the tennis calendar, Sportico released its 2025 highest paid tennis players list. Now, the top five highest paid tennis players on the list were filled with the sport's biggest names. World men's number one, Jannikinner topped the list at $52.3 million earned from prize.Money, endorsements, bonuses, and appearance fees. Five-time Grand Slam winner Carlos Alcaraz ranked second with $49 million. American women superstar Cocoa was 3rd with $35.2 million in annual earnings, and world women's number one, Irina Sabalenka came in fourth on the list with $25.4 million followed by 24-time Grand Slam winner Novak Djokovic, who had 24%.$4 million in earnings. All told, the top 10 highest paid tennis players made a collected $272 million in the past year, which is a 13% increase from Sportico's 2024 list. However, that figure heavily skewed in favor of off-court earnings, with the top 10 highest paid players earning 35% from prize money and 65% from endorsements, bonuses, and appearance fees.The sharp imbalance between on-court and off-court earnings highlights the global appeal tennis athletes have with their personal brands. The big two of Carlos Alcaraz and Yanak Sinner led the pack when it came to off-court income, with Alcarez earning $36 million in endorsements, including over $10 million a year from Nike, and Sinner making $25 million from brands like Nike, Lavaza, and racket Company Head, among others. But not far behind Cin was 2025 French Open winner Coco.Gaul, who made $23 million in endorsement money from deals with top brands like New Balance, L'Oreal, UPS, Rolex, and others. Plus 5 female players earned at least $10 million in sponsorship and endorsement income over the past year, including 4-time Grand Slam winner Naomi Osaka. And now the world's highest paid players on Sportico's list will look to add even more money to their 2025 earnings by winning the $5 million championship singles prize on the line at this year's US Open.We're all out of time, so it's officially game over for this week.

And Allie, you know, we've talked to a lot of investors who have said even though there's one line of thinking that crypto doesn't correlate to anything, there's certainly another line of thinking that there is an interest rate sensitivity there and that rate cutting would be good for those types of companies.\n\n00:56 Speaker B\n\nYeah, and heading into this week, there had been a lot of commentary whether or not Bitcoin was reaching bubble territory and whether or not these crypto assets were rising a little bit too quickly. But we're seeing this risk-on rally today. We're seeing that reaction directly correlated in Bitcoin, which is the largest cryptocurrency. We are now up over 117,000 a coin. Before Powell's speech, we were closer to 112,000. So that just goes to show how quickly we've been rising here. Now over the past five days, we are still off around two tenths of a percent and we've really been struggling to get over $120,000 a coin. That has been really branded as this, uh, technical threshold by strategists, and we haven't really been able to hit that mark here. But you talked about those crypto adjacent companies. We're seeing names like Riot, Circle, Hive, Galaxy Digital surging today. Riot is up 9%. Circle, which is really benefited from the stablecoin boom, that's also approaching double digit gains. So all in all, just for crypto stocks for the speculative trade at large, we are seeing this rally across the board.\n\n02:52 Speaker A\n\nYeah, and speaking of rate sensitivity, another group that we got to talk about, homebuilders. Homebuilder stocks are also getting a lift here because the sector has traditionally been the beneficiary of rate cuts. Today's gains follow this week's better than expected news on housing starts for July. You know, Allie, we've been talking to a lot of folks who are sort of desperate for mortgage rates to come down to unlock the housing market.\n\n03:35 Speaker B\n\nYeah, the housing market just has been completely stuck. And you're right. Now that we have the expectation, at least on the part of markets, that we could be seeing rate cuts at a quicker pace, or at least in September, that is an encouraging sign when we think about borrowing costs for these, um, homeowners or would-be homeowners. You're seeing home builders across the board, uh, up. We have Lennar up 5% today. You have DR Horton also up around the same amount. Uh, KB Home is up, uh, 7% at this point. Toll Brothers up 6%. So across the board here, you're seeing those gains even in some of these home improvement companies, like Lowe's, Home Depot, we recently heard from them when it comes to earnings. They are up today. And, uh, they they did reference the fact that their business is so correlated with mortgage rates. And Home Depot said that as mortgage rates have ticked down a little bit from the highs that we saw earlier this year, that helped some of that activity. So this is only going to be a benefit for a lot of these companies that are tied so closely to the economy and really the purchasing behavior and patterns on the part of consumers.\n\n05:35 Speaker A\n\nAnd finally, let's talk banks to the KBW Bank Index up nearly 3% on pace to hit its first record since 2022. Small caps, regional banks getting a boost as well from these rate expectations.\n\n06:03 Speaker B\n\nYeah, now I was just talking about small caps how they've been rallying, regional banks. I mean, it's pretty much the same story there. And they benefit from a few things when it comes to lower interest rates. One is that regional banks, they heavily rely on deposits for funding. And when rates are high, they often have to pay depositors more in order to keep that money in the bank. So a Fed rate cut eases some of that pressure. And similar to what we saw with homebuilders, it also is encouraging that lower rates means cheaper borrowing costs for those homeowners, for businesses, and that just means more activity for these banks at large. So the big banks doing well, but the regionals really a standout here too, Julie.\n\n07:12 Speaker A\n\nYes, in focus. Thank you so much.

Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including NVIDIA Corp. (NVDA), Cisco Systems, Inc. (CSCO) and Linde plc (LIN). These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.\r\n\r\nYou can see all of today’s research reports here >>>\r\n\r\nAhead of Wall Street\r\n\r\nThe daily 'Ahead of Wall Street' article is a must-read for all investors who would like to be ready for that day's trading action. The article comes out before the market opens, attempting to make sense of that morning's economic releases and how they will affect that day's market action.

The company is benefiting from the strong growth of artificial intelligence (AI) and high-performance, accelerated computing. The growing demand for generative AI and large language models using graphic processing units (GPUs) based on NVIDIA’s Hopper and Blackwell architectures is aiding data center revenues. \r\n\r\nThe continued ramp-up of Ada RTX GPU workstations in the ProViz end market, following the normalization of channel inventory, is acting as a tailwind. Collaborations with more than 320 automakers and tier-one suppliers are likely to advance its presence in the autonomous vehicle space. \r\n\r\nThe Zacks analyst expect NVIDIA’s revenues to witness a CAGR of 29% through fiscal 2026-2028. However, a limited supply of Blackwell GPUs could hinder its ability to meet demand. Rising costs associated with the production of more complex AI systems will hurt margins.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on NVIDIA here >>>)\r\n\r\nShares of Cisco have outperformed the Zacks Computer - Networking industry over the year-to-date period (+16.1% vs. +15.1%). The company’s business model has evolved with subscription revenues accounting for more than half of its total revenues. Increase in recurring revenue base bodes well for investors. Splunk acquisition enhances its recurring revenue base. \r\n\r\nThe buyout significantly expands Cisco’s portfolio of software-based solutions, contributing more than $4 billion in ARR and makes it one of the largest software companies in the world. The launch of AI-powered Hypershield, which combines security and networking, strengthened Cisco’s security portfolio. \r\n\r\nHowever, it has been suffering from sluggish networking sales, primarily due to lackluster demand from telecommunication and cable services providers, as well as stiff competition. Cisco’s prospects are further challenged in the AI-driven networking space due to stiffening competition.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on Cisco here >>>)\r\n\r\nLinde’s shares have outperformed the Zacks Chemical - Specialty industry over the year-to-date period (+16.2% vs. +8.4%). The company remains a dominant player in the industrial gas sector, delivering strong financial performance with consistent EPS growth, disciplined capital allocation, and industry-leading margins.\r\n\r\nLinde’s record $10.3 billion backlog ensures long-term revenue stability, while sustainability initiatives position it as a leader in low-carbon energy solutions. Strategic investments in high-return projects and small on-site contracts further reinforce its competitive edge. \r\n\r\nHowever, foreign exchange headwinds, softening industrial demand in Europe & China, and regulatory uncertainties pose challenges. Also, slower growth in healthcare impacts diversification efforts. Despite these risks, LIN's strong execution, efficiency improvements, & long-term contracts position it well for sustained profitability & resilience in fluctuating market conditions.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on Linde here >>>)\r\n\r\nOther noteworthy reports we are featuring today include Pfizer Inc. (PFE), Aflac Inc. (AFL) and Western Digital Corp.

            "content": "Multiple investment firms boosted Nvidia (NVDA) stock price targets ahead of its Aug. 27 earnings report, with analyst expectations showing strong momentum. According to a report from Seeking Alpha, KeyBanc raised its NVDA stock price target to $215 from $190, Susquehanna increased it to $210 from $180, and HSBC hiked it to $200 from $125.\n\nFor fiscal 2026 (ending in January), analysts forecast revenue of $202.44 billion, while the top-line for 2027 is projected at $259.36 billion, up from $130.5 billion in fiscal 2025. Current quarter expectations call for $45.97 billion in revenue, representing 53% year-over-year growth. Earnings per share are expected to increase to $1.01 per share in fiscal Q2 of 2026, up from $0.68 per share last year.\n\nMore News from Barchart\n\nShould You Buy the Dip as Palantir Stock Falls for 7 Straight Days?

KeyBanc expects guidance excluding direct China revenue due to pending license approvals, though inclusion could add $2-3 billion. HSBC notes the artificial intelligence (AI) GPU market exceeded expectations but warns of China-related risks, including lower pricing and potential pushback from Chinese authorities.www.barchart.com\n\nIs Nvidia Still a Good Stock to Buy?\n\nIn fiscal Q1, Nvidia reported revenue of $44 billion, an increase of 69% year-over-year (YoY), showcasing the company's commanding position in the AI revolution that's reshaping global computing infrastructure. Nvidia’s multi-platform strategy positions it perfectly for sustained long-term growth across several expanding markets.\n\nThe transition to NVIDIA's Blackwell architecture has been remarkable, contributing nearly 70% of Data Center compute revenue with the fastest product ramp in company history. Major hyperscalers are deploying almost 1,000 NVL72 racks weekly, equivalent to 72,000 Blackwell GPUs per week.\n\nThis massive scale demonstrates both customer confidence and NVIDIA's manufacturing excellence. Microsoft (MSFT) alone has deployed tens of thousands of Blackwell GPUs and plans to scale to hundreds of thousands of GB200s.\n\nThe emergence of reasoning AI models has fundamentally changed the compute landscape. Microsoft processed over 100 trillion tokens in Q1, a fivefold YoY increase. DeepSeek and similar reasoning models generate 13 times more tokens than traditional AI models, creating exponential inference demand. NVIDIA's GB200 NVL72 delivers 30 times higher inference throughput, making it the ideal platform for this compute-intensive workload.\n\nStory Continues\n\nMultiple Emerging Growth Vectors for NVDA Stock\n\nNvidia's business extends far beyond data center GPUs. Gaming revenue hit record levels at $3.8 billion in Q1, growing 48% sequentially. The recently released Nintendo Switch 2 leverages Nvidia's custom RTX technology, tapping into its predecessor's 150-million-console installed base. Networking revenue surged 64% quarter-over-quarter (QoQ) to $5 billion, with Spectrum-X annualizing over $8 billion as major cloud providers adopt NVIDIA's enhanced Ethernet solutions.\n\nSovereign AI represents a massive new opportunity as nations recognize AI as essential infrastructure. Nearly 100 AI factories are currently under construction globally, with projects requiring tens of gigawatts of Nvidia infrastructure on the horizon. Enterprise AI is accelerating with new RTX Pro systems enabling on-premises deployment, addressing the $500 billion IT infrastructure market.\n\nMoreover, Nvidia returned a record $14.3 billion to shareholders through buybacks and dividends, demonstrating management's confidence in future cash generation.\n\nWhat Is the Target Price for NVDA Stock?\n\nAnalysts tracking NVDA stock forecast revenue to rise from $130.5 billion in fiscal 2025 to $362.5 billion in 2030. In this period, adjusted earnings are forecast to expand from $2.99 per share to $8.67 per share.\n\nToday, NVDA stock trades at a forward price to earnings multiple of 35x, which is higher than its 10-year average of 32x. As growth normalizes, NVDA stock could revert to an earnings multiple of 25x, which suggests it will trade around $217 in early 2029, indicating an upside potential of 24% from current levels.\n\nOut of the 46 analysts covering NVDA stock, 38 recommend “Strong Buy,” two recommend “Moderate Buy,” five recommend “Hold,” and one recommends “Strong Sell.” The average NVDA stock price target is $192, above the current price of $178.www.barchart.com\n\nOn the date of publication, Aditya Raghunath did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

            "title": "Dell Technologies vs. Apple: Which PC Maker Stock is a Better Buy?",
            "content": "Dell Technologies DELL and Apple AAPL are leading personal computer (PC) makers in a market that is now expected to see year-over-year shipment growth of 4.1% in 2025, per IDC.  Global PC shipment volume is expected to hit 274 million in 2025, driven by growing demand for artificial intelligence (AI)-powered PCs and the transition to Microsoft Windows 11. However, U.S. tariffs on partners like China and a challenging macroeconomic environment are expected to hurt second-half 2025 PC shipments.\r\n\r\nSo, Dell Technologies or Apple, which is a better buy under the current scenario?\n\nThe Case for Dell Technologies Stock\n\nDell Technologies is benefiting from strong demand for commercial PCs. In first-quarter fiscal 2026, Client Solutions Group (CSG) revenues were $12.5 billion, up 5% year over year. Commercial Client revenues increased 9% year over year to $11.04 billion. The company saw double-digit demand growth across small and medium businesses and large enterprises. Commercial demand was strongest in North America, with Europe, the Middle East, and Africa (EMEA), and Asia Pacific and Japan (APJ), increasing in the double-digit range.\r\n\r\nDell Technologies’ commercial growth is driven by an innovative portfolio. The company offers the broadest portfolio of Copilot+ capable AI PCs. The new Dell Pro Max notebooks and desktops are equipped with NVIDIA RTX PRO Blackwell GPUs, Intel Core Ultra processors, and AMD Ryzen and Threadripper processors. The Dell AI Factory combines DELL’s solutions and services optimized for AI workloads and supports an open ecosystem of partners comprising Meta Platforms, Microsoft and Hugging Face, apart from NVIDIA. \r\n\r\nHowever, consumer business remains weak with revenues declining 19% due to stiff competition from the likes of Lenovo and HP HPQ. Per IDC, DELL had a market share of 9.8%, down 140 basis points (bps) on a year-over-year basis in the second quarter of calendar 2025. Lenovo led with a market share of 24.8% trailed by HP’s 20.7%. DELL’s second-quarter shipment grew 3% year over year to hit 9.8 million, trailing both HP’s and Lenovo’s shipments of 14.1 million and 17 million. According to Gartner, DELL shares fell 110 bps while shipments fell 3% year over year in the second quarter of 2025.\r\n\r\nBased on commercial demand, Dell Technologies expects CSG revenues to increase in the low-to-mid single digits for both second-quarter fiscal 2026 and fiscal 2026. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for second-quarter fiscal 2026 revenues is pegged at $12.89 billion, indicating 4% growth from the figure reported in the year-ago quarter.\n\nStory Continues\n\nThe Case for Apple Stock\n\nApple’s Mac business is benefiting from strong demand for M4, M4 Pro, and M4 Max chips. In March, Apple expanded its Mac portfolio with the new MacBook Air powered by the M4 chip with up to 18 hours of battery life and a new 12MP Center Stage camera. Apple also announced the new Mac Studio featuring M4 Max and the new M3 Ultra chip. The new chip is the most powerful created by Apple and features double Neural Engine cores, Thunderbolt 5 with more than 2 times the bandwidth per port for faster connectivity and robust expansion.\n\nIn April, Apple expanded the availability of Apple Intelligence with iOS 18.4, iPadOS 18.4, and macOS Sequoia 15.4 updates in new languages, including French, German, Italian, Portuguese (Brazil), Spanish, Japanese, Korean, and Chinese (simplified), as well as localized English for Singapore and India. The features help Mac users the ability to create a memory movie by simply typing a description, and an added Sketch style in Image Playground. Apple is set to launch new features with the upcoming macOS Tahoe 26 update.\r\n\r\nApple’s strong Mac portfolio helped it gain market share in the second quarter of 2025. Per IDC, Apple had a market share of 9.1%, up 110 bps on a year-over-year basis. Shipment grew 21.4% year over year to hit 6.2 million. According to Gartner, Mac shares inched up 70 bps while shipments increased 13.4% year over year.\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for Apple’s fourth-quarter fiscal 2025 Mac revenues is currently pegged at $8.05 billion, indicating 14.8% growth over the figure reported in the year-ago quarter.\n\nDELL’s & AAPL’s Earnings Estimate Revision Positive\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for DELL’s fiscal 2026 earnings is pegged at $9.47 per share, up by a couple of cents over the past 30 days, indicating a 16.3% increase over fiscal 2025’s reported figure.\n\nDell Technologies Inc. Price and ConsensusDell Technologies Inc. Price and Consensus\n\nDell Technologies Inc. price-consensus-chart | Dell Technologies Inc. Quote\n\nThe consensus mark for AAPL’s fiscal 2025 earnings has increased 3.1% to $7.33 per share over the past 30 days, suggesting 8.6% growth over fiscal 2024.\n\nApple Inc. Price and ConsensusApple Inc. Price and Consensus\n\nApple Inc. price-consensus-chart | Apple Inc.

AAPLZacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nValuation-wise, Dell Technologies shares are cheaper compared with Apple. While DELL has a Value Score of B, Apple has a Value Score of F, suggesting stretched valuation for the iPhone-maker. \r\n\r\nIn terms of forward 12-month Price/Sales, Dell Technologies shares are trading at 0.8X, lower than Apple’s 7.84X.\n\nDELL and AAPL ValuationZacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nHere is Why DELL is a Better Buy than AAPL\n\nDell Technologies’ strong AI-powered PC portfolio and a rich partner base are noteworthy apart from a cheaper valuation. Although Apple benefits from strong demand for Mac, China-related tariffs, where Apple has significant production, are a significant risk for the iPhone-maker.\r\n\r\nDell Technologies currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), which implies that the stock is a better buy compared with Apple, which currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

            "content": "Investors looking for stocks in the Medical - Products sector might want to consider either Envista (NVST) or Abbott (ABT). But which of these two stocks offers value investors a better bang for their buck right now? We'll need to take a closer look.\n\nEveryone has their own methods for finding great value opportunities, but our model includes pairing an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system with a strong Zacks Rank. The Zacks Rank favors stocks with strong earnings estimate revision trends, and our Style Scores highlight companies with specific traits.\n\nCurrently, Envista has a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy), while Abbott has a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold). This system places an emphasis on companies that have seen positive earnings estimate revisions, so investors should feel comfortable knowing that NVST is likely seeing its earnings outlook improve to a greater extent. But this is just one factor that value investors are interested in.\n\nValue investors also tend to look at a number of traditional, tried-and-true figures to help them find stocks that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels.\n\nThe Style Score Value grade factors in a variety of key fundamental metrics, including the popular P/E ratio, P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a number of other key stats that are commonly used by value investors.\n\nNVST currently has a forward P/E ratio of 19.35, while ABT has a forward P/E of 25.75. We also note that NVST has a PEG ratio of 1.15. This popular figure is similar to the widely-used P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also considers a company's expected EPS growth rate. ABT currently has a PEG ratio of 2.51.\n\nAnother notable valuation metric for NVST is its P/B ratio of 1.15. The P/B is a method of comparing a stock's market value to its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. By comparison, ABT has a P/B of 4.54.\n\nBased on these metrics and many more, NVST holds a Value grade of B, while ABT has a Value grade of C.\n\nNVST sticks out from ABT in both our Zacks Rank and Style Scores models, so value investors will likely feel that NVST is the better option right now.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

            "content": "Benzinga and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue on some items through the links below.\n\nAbbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) is a global healthcare company that develops and sells a wide range of health technologies and products.\n\nIt is set to report its Q3 2025 earnings on Oct. 15. Wall Street analysts expect the company to post EPS of $1.30, up from $1.21 in the prior-year period. According to Benzinga Pro, quarterly revenue is expected to reach $11.41 billion, up from $10.63 billion a year earlier.\n\nDon't Miss:\n\nThe same firms that backed Uber, Venmo and eBay are investing in this pre-IPO company disrupting a $1.8T market — and you can too at just $2.90/share. Kevin O'Leary Says Real Estate's Been a Smart Bet for 200 Years — This Platform Lets Anyone Tap Into It\n\nIf You Bought Abbott Laboratories Stock 10 Years Ago\n\nThe company's stock traded at approximately $43.70 per share 10 years ago. If you had invested $10,000, you could have bought roughly 229 shares. Currently, shares trade at $132.29, meaning your investment's value could have grown to $30,261 from stock price appreciation alone. However, Abbott Laboratories also paid dividends during these 10 years.\n\nAbbott Laboratories' dividend yield is currently 1.79%. Over the last 10 years, it has paid about $16.59 in dividends per share, which means you could have made $3,796 from dividends alone.\n\nSumming up $30,261 and $3,796, we end up with the final value of your investment, which is $34,057. This is how much you could have made if you had invested $10,000 in Abbott Laboratories stock 10 years ago. This means a total return of 240.60%. However, this figure is less than the S&P 500 total return for the same period, which was 307.50%.\n\nTrending: An EA Co-Founder Shapes This VC Backed Marketplace—Now You Can Invest in Gaming's Next Big Platform\n\nWhat Could The Next 10 Years Bring?\n\nAbbott Laboratories has a consensus rating of \"Buy\" and a price target of $139.60 based on the ratings of 26 analysts. The price target implies more than 5% potential upside from the current stock price.\n\nThe company on July 17 announced its Q2 2025 earnings, posting adjusted EPS of $1.26, compared to the consensus estimate of $1.25, and revenues of $11.14 billion, compared to the consensus of $11.07 billion, as reported by Benzinga.\n\n“Halfway through the year, we delivered high single-digit organic sales growth, double-digit EPS growth, significantly expanded our margin profiles, and continued to advance key programs through our new product pipeline,” said CEO Robert B. Ford. “We see this momentum carrying into 2026.”\n\nStory Continues\n\nAbbott projects its full-year 2025 adjusted diluted EPS to be between $5.10 and $5.20.\n\nSee Also: The ECG Hasn't Changed in 100 Years — This AI Upgrade Could Help Detect Heart Disease Years Earlier\n\nCheck out this article by Benzinga, which looks into Abbott Laboratories’ recent short interest.\n\nGiven the expected upside potential of just 5%, growth-focused investors may not find Abbott Laboratories stock attractive. Conversely, the stock can be a good option for income-focused investors, who can benefit from the company's solid dividend yield of 1.79% and consistent hikes. Abbott Laboratories has raised its dividend consecutively for the last 53 years.\n\nRead Next: Arrived Home's Private Credit Fund’s has historically paid an annualized dividend yield of 8.1%*, which provides access to a pool of short-term loans backed by residential real estate with just a $100 minimum.\n\nImage: Shutterstock\n\nThis article If You Invested $10K In Abbott Laboratories Stock 10 Years Ago, How Much Would You Have Now? originally appeared on Benzinga.com\n\nView Comments",

Lynch's common sense approach and quick wit made him one of the most quoted investors on Wall Street. (\"Go for a business that any idiot can run -- because sooner or later, any idiot probably is going to run it,\" is one of his many pearls of wisdom.) Lynch's bestseller One Up on Wall Street is something of a \"stocks for the everyman/everywoman\", breaking his approach down into easy-to-understand concepts.\n\nAdditional Research Links\n\nTop Healthcare Stocks\n\nDividend Aristocrats2023\n\nWide Moat Stocks2023\n\nHigh Insider Ownership Stocks\n\nFactor-Based Stock Portfolios\n\nExcess Returns Investing Podcast\n\nAbout Validea: Validea is aninvestment researchservice that follows the published strategies of investment legends.

            "title": "FCIcoin Advances Asset-Backed Tokenization as the Next Phase of Blockchain Finance",
            "content": "NEW YORK, Aug.  25, 2025  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- FCIcoin, a blockchain-native infrastructure platform for institutional trading, has announced its strategic commitment to advancing asset-backed tokenization (ABT) as a core pillar of its 2025–2026 development roadmap. As blockchain finance matures beyond speculative crypto assets, the next wave of innovation is being defined by tangible value—tokens anchored in real-world, income-generating or growth-driven assets.\n\nUnlike traditional utility tokens or equity-based offerings, asset-backed tokens offer a hybrid model: they combine the liquidity and programmability of digital tokens with the transparency and growth potential of real assets. These assets can include equity in emerging industries such as biotechnology, AI applications, edge computing, renewable energy, and aerospace innovation.\n\n“Asset-backed tokenization isn’t just a technical layer—it’s a structural evolution,” said Jonathan Patterson, a senior strategist at FCIcoin. “We’re not building tokens for speculation. We’re building a new framework for transparent, programmable ownership.”\n\nThe Next Evolution of Blockchain Finance\r\nAs traditional capital markets explore tokenized securities and decentralized finance continues to experiment with yield-bearing products, ABT sits at the intersection—providing verified value with on-chain utility. In contrast to typical equity offerings, asset-backed tokens can be fractionalized, traded globally 24/7, governed via smart contracts, and issued with embedded compliance.\n\nThis structure enables more democratic capital access while lowering the barriers for asset owners to engage global investors. Compared to stock issuance, ABTs offer faster settlement, reduced intermediary costs, and programmable rights management. Compared to pure crypto tokens, ABTs are grounded in fundamental value, reducing volatility and enabling valuation based on underlying growth or cash flows.\n\nThis trend has become even clearer following the recent passage of the U.S. GENIUS Act, which established clear regulations for stablecoin issuance and requires every token to be backed by an equivalent amount of U.S. dollar assets. In practice, this is only the beginning of ABTs. In the coming years, more cryptocurrencies backed by real-world underlying assets will emerge, creating the need for a new generation of blockchain infrastructure. Building that foundation is precisely what FCIcoin aims to achieve.\n\nInfrastructure for Trust: FCIcoin’s Approach\r\nTo support this shift, FCIcoin is building a specialized blockchain architecture designed for real-world asset tokenization. This includes:\r\n- A New Chain for Institutional ABT Deployment: FCIcoin is finalizing a modular Layer-1 blockchain specifically optimized for issuing and managing asset-backed tokens, with native support for compliance, real-asset anchoring, and real-time audit integration.\r\n- Legal and Jurisdictional Compliance Framework: The company is collaborating with international legal advisors to define compliant issuance models across the U.S., EU, and Asia. Smart contracts will enforce KYC/AML layers and regulatory disclosures on-chain.\r\n- Encrypted Identity and Disclosure Layer: A dual-encryption framework is being developed to protect beneficial owner identities while allowing verified disclosure to authorized parties and regulators. This layer is critical for balancing privacy and transparency in institutional-grade token offerings.\r\n- Blockchain Governance Tools: FCIcoin’s token issuance module includes programmable governance structures—allowing asset holders and tokenized communities to define rights, votes, and incentives on-chain.\r\n- Custodial Protocols for Real Assets: For physical or off-chain underlying assets, FCIcoin is implementing third-party custodial attestations and token redemption safeguards to ensure asset-link validity.\r\n- Next-Generation Trading App: A new application supporting blockchain and ABT transactions is also under development, with release targeted for early 2026.\n\n“Tokenization must do more than mirror traditional finance,” said the head of protocol design. “It must outperform it in flexibility, accessibility, and trust. That’s what we’re building toward.”\n\nFive Strategic Offerings Coming in 2025\r\nIn the second half of 2025, FCIcoin will debut five asset-backed token launches—each backed by equity stakes in high-growth, frontier-sector companies. These include:\r\n1. Biotech Innovation Token: Representing equity exposure in a portfolio of emerging biotech startups focused on therapeutics and genetic engineering.\r\n2. AI and Edge Infrastructure Token: Backed by firms developing next-generation AI applications and distributed computing frameworks.\r\n3. Clean Energy Growth Token: Tied to equity in renewable energy developers and carbon-negative infrastructure providers.\r\n4. Aerospace and Orbital Tech Token: Reflecting investment in early-stage companies targeting space logistics, satellite tech, and launch platforms.\r\n5. AI-Powered Education & Investment Network Token: Backed by an integrated digital platform delivering AI-driven trading systems, investor education, and analytics tools to a global user base.\n\nEach issuance will follow strict compliance, include full on-chain documentation, and be auditable through multi-layer custody verification.\n\nToken issuance will follow a tiered model, with accredited investor classes, community allocations, and validator incentives structured differently based on regulatory frameworks and asset jurisdictions. These distinctions will be transparently disclosed and built into issuance contracts. FCIcoin is also exploring on-chain dispute resolution tools and insurance mechanisms to enhance trust and reduce coordination risk in multi-asset token ecosystems.\n\nAdditionally, each token issuance will be accompanied by a technical factsheet and public smart contract audit, allowing users to verify token logic and governance mechanics independently. FCIcoin will also launch a governance dashboard in Q4 2025 to allow users to delegate votes, track proposals, and participate in transparent governance cycles on-chain.\n\nTo ensure long-term alignment between asset holders and tokenized communities, each asset-backed token issued by FCIcoin will include embedded governance rights. These rights may include voting on portfolio decisions, reinvestment terms, or protocol updates, depending on the structure of the underlying asset class. FCIcoin is committed to offering governance models that are both flexible and enforceable via smart contracts.\n\nVision Forward\r\nFCIcoin’s ABT initiative is not merely a financial innovation—it is an architectural response to a new era of programmable capital. With infrastructure that integrates legal trust, technical assurance, and economic transparency, the company aims to lead the market in institutional-grade tokenization.\n\nAs regulations evolve and market expectations shift toward verified utility, FCIcoin’s goal is clear: to create the rails for a future where ownership is digital, liquid, and rooted in real, growing value.\n\nMedia Contact:\r\nCompany: FCICOIN\n\nContact Person: Christopher P.

            "title": "NVDA Earnings, PCE and Other Key Things to Watch this Week",
            "content": "Markets enter a defining week following Friday's dramatic turnaround that saw the S&P 500 ($SPX [https://www.barchart.com/futures/quotes/$SPX/overview]) (SPY [https://www.barchart.com/etfs-funds/quotes/SPY/overview]) and Dow hit new highs after Fed Chair Jerome Powell's game-changing Jackson Hole speech declared that conditions \"may warrant\" rate cuts. The market rally struggled for much of last week, particularly hitting Nasdaq and growth stocks hard, before Powell's dovish pivot triggered a powerful Friday rebound that lifted indexes and leading stocks from or above key technical levels. The key question facing investors is whether Friday's growth stock resurgence represents a sustainable reassertion of market leadership or merely a one-off relief rally, with defense plays having shown relative strength during the week's volatility but finishing with more muted gains. Wednesday's Nvidia (NVDA [https://www.barchart.com/stocks/quotes/nvda]) earnings and guidance will serve as the ultimate test for both the market rally's sustainability and which sectors will lead going forward. The week also brings Friday's Core PCE Price Index alongside Q2 GDP revisions and a packed earnings calendar featuring cloud computing and AI infrastructure companies.\n\nHere are 5 things to watch this week in the Market.\n\nNVIDIA'S AI EMPIRE ASSESSMENT\n\nWednesday's Nvidia (NVDA [https://www.barchart.com/stocks/quotes/nvda]) earnings represent the week's most consequential event, serving as both a litmus test for the AI infrastructure buildout and a catalyst that could determine market leadership going forward. The results will be closely scrutinized for data center revenue growth, gaming segment performance, and crucially, management's guidance about future AI chip demand and pricing trends. Nvidia's commentary on customer inventory levels, competition from custom chips developed by hyperscalers, and the sustainability of current AI investment cycles will be particularly important given recent volatility in technology stocks and Friday's dramatic growth stock rebound. The earnings come at a critical juncture as investors question whether growth stocks can maintain momentum following Powell's dovish Jackson Hole comments or if recent defensive rotations will resume. Nvidia's results could significantly influence not only semiconductor stocks but also cloud computing companies, AI infrastructure plays, and the broader technology sector that has driven much of this year's market gains.\n\nPOWELL PIVOT FOLLOW-THROUGH AND FED POLICY\n\nFriday's Core PCE Price Index at 8:30am will provide the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation measure, taking on heightened significance following Powell's Jackson Hole speech that opened the door to rate cuts by suggesting conditions \"may warrant\" policy adjustments. Both month-over-month and year-over-year readings will be closely watched for evidence supporting Powell's more dovish stance or potential contradictions that could complicate the Fed's messaging. The data arrives as markets have rapidly repriced rate cut expectations, with September 17 odds around 85% and investors betting on multiple cuts through year-end. Wednesday's FOMC meeting minutes at 2pm will provide additional context for interpreting Powell's Jackson Hole pivot, offering insights into the internal Fed discussions that shaped recent policy thinking. Any significant deviation in inflation data from expectations could either reinforce or undermine Powell's dovish shift, creating substantial volatility in rate-sensitive sectors.\n\nCLOUD COMPUTING AND CYBERSECURITY EARNINGS\n\nWednesday brings a critical test for cloud infrastructure and cybersecurity sectors with Snowflake (SNOW [https://www.barchart.com/stocks/quotes/snow]) and CrowdStrike (CRWD [https://www.barchart.com/stocks/quotes/crwd]) reporting alongside Nvidia. Snowflake's results will provide insights into data analytics demand and cloud data warehouse adoption amid ongoing enterprise digital transformation trends. CrowdStrike's earnings will offer perspective on cybersecurity spending and enterprise security priorities, particularly important given increasing global cyber threats and regulatory compliance requirements. These results will help determine whether Friday's growth stock rally can sustain momentum or if recent defensive rotations will resume. Both companies represent high-growth technology plays that have been sensitive to interest rate expectations and investor risk appetite, making their results particularly relevant following Powell's dovish comments.\n\nECONOMIC GROWTH AND CONSUMER FUNDAMENTALS\n\nThursday's Q2 GDP revision at 8:30am will provide an updated view of economic growth momentum, while Tuesday's durable goods orders and consumer confidence data offer insights into business investment and household sentiment. The GDP revision comes amid ongoing questions about economic sustainability and provides context for the Fed's policy deliberations following Powell's Jackson Hole speech. Consumer confidence at 10am Tuesday will be particularly important for assessing household optimism about future economic conditions and spending intentions in light of recent labor market changes. Monday's new home sales data will provide additional perspective on housing market trends amid evolving mortgage rate expectations following Powell's dovish pivot. The convergence of growth measurements and forward-looking indicators creates potential for significant market reactions if data collectively suggests accelerating or decelerating economic momentum.\n\nGLOBAL TECHNOLOGY AND GEOPOLITICAL BACKDROP\n\nThe week features several international technology earnings providing global perspective on digital trends and enterprise spending. PDD Holdings (PDD [https://www.barchart.com/stocks/quotes/pdd]) Monday will offer insights into Chinese e-commerce and consumer behavior, while Alibaba (BABA [https://www.barchart.com/stocks/quotes/baba]) Friday provides additional perspective on Asian market dynamics. Dell (DELL [https://www.barchart.com/stocks/quotes/dell]) and Marvell (MRVL [https://www.barchart.com/stocks/quotes/mrvl]) Thursday will provide insights into enterprise hardware demand and semiconductor trends. The earnings backdrop unfolds amid ongoing geopolitical developments following Trump's meetings with Putin and Zelenskyy, which could influence international business sentiment and cross-border technology investments. Companies with significant international exposure may face questions about geopolitical risks and supply chain considerations during their earnings calls.\n\nBest of luck this week and don't forget to check out my daily options article [https://www.barchart.com/news/authors/113/gavin-mcmaster].\n\n_ On the date of publication, Gavin McMaster [https://www.barchart.com/news/authors/113/gavin-mcmaster] had a position in: SPY [https://www.barchart.com/quotes/SPY] .

            "content": "[Rolled newspaper with the headline Quarterly Results]\nZerbor\n\nNext week marks the final stretch of August earnings, and it’s stacked with market-moving names across AI, tech, retail, financials, and energy.\n\nOn the tech front, results from NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NVDA]), Alibaba (NYSE:BABA [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BABA]), CrowdStrike (NASDAQ:CRWD [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CRWD]), Snowflake (NYSE:SNOW [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SNOW]), Marvell Technology (NASDAQ:MRVL [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MRVL]), Okta (NASDAQ:OKTA [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/OKTA]), Dell (NYSE:DELL [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/DELL]), MongoDB (NASDAQ:MDB [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MDB]), and Autodesk (NASDAQ:ADSK [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ADSK]) will provide a pulse check on AI adoption, cloud spending, and enterprise software demand.\n\nIn retail, investors will be watching Best Buy (NYSE:BBY [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BBY]), Dollar General (NYSE:DG [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/DG]), Ulta Beauty (NASDAQ:ULTA [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ULTA]), Kohl’s (NYSE:KSS [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/KSS]), Abercrombie & Fitch (NYSE:ANF [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ANF]), The Gap (GAP [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GAP]), DICK’S Sporting Goods (NYSE:DKS [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/DKS]), Urban Outfitters (NASDAQ:URBN [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/URBN]), Bath & Body Works (NYSE:BBWI [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BBWI]), and Victoria’s Secret (NYSE:VSCO [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/VSCO]) for clues on consumer resilience heading into the holiday season.\n\nFinancial heavyweights including Toronto-Dominion (NYSE:TD [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/TD]), Bank of Nova Scotia (NYSE:BNS [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BNS]), Royal Bank of Canada (NYSE:RY [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/RY]), Bank of Montreal (NYSE:BMO [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BMO]), and Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce (NYSE:CM [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CM]) will shed light on credit demand and lending trends.\n\nMeanwhile, Li Auto (NASDAQ:LI [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/LI]), PDD Holdings (NASDAQ:PDD [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/PDD]), Trip.com (TCOM [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/TCOM]), Frontline (FRO [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/FRO]), Sibanye Stillwater (SBSW [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SBSW]), Daqo New Energy (DQ [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/DQ]), Hormel Foods (HRL [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/HRL]), and J.M. Smucker (SJM [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SJM]) round out a diverse slate of reports spanning EVs, commodities, energy, and consumer staples.\n\nWith NVIDIA’s AI momentum, China’s tech giants, and U.S. retailers all reporting in the same week, markets are set for a busy and potentially volatile close to August.\n\nBelow is a rundown of major earnings reports due in the week of August 25 to August 29:\n\nMONDAY, AUGUST 25\n\nPINDUODUO (NASDAQ:PDD [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/PDD])\n\nChinese e-commerce giant Pinduoduo (PDD [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/PDD]) is set to release its Q2 results before the market opens on Monday. Analysts are projecting a significant Y/Y decline in profits, exceeding 37%.\n\nDespite this forecast, PDD's stock has been a standout performer in 2025, with a YTD gain of approximately 27%, far outpacing the broader market.\n\nThe company's performance has led to a split in opinion among analysts. While Wall Street maintains a bullish stance with a Buy rating, Seeking Alpha's Quant system has assigned a Hold rating [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/PDD/ratings/quant-ratings#source=firstLevelUrl%3Asymbol%7CbiSectionAsset%3ARatingSummary%7CbiName%3AQuant_rating].\n\nSA Investing Group Leader Envision Research also maintains [https://seekingalpha.com/article/4807017-jdcom-vs-pdd-evaluation-makes-me-favor-pdd-amid-trade-conflicts] a Buy, noting that while recent trade tensions have increased uncertainty for both JD.com (JD [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/JD]) and PDD, Pinduoduo is better positioned for resilience. Drawing from Peter Lynch’s investment principles, the analysis highlights PDD’s superior profitability, valuation, and operating metrics compared to JD, reinforcing its leadership in China’s fast-growing e-commerce market.\n\n \t* Consensus EPS Estimates: $2.06\n \t* Consensus Revenue Estimates: $14.36B\n \t* Earnings Insight: Pinduoduo has beaten EPS estimates in 6 of the past 8 quarters, and revenue expectations in 4 of those reports.\n\nALSO REPORTING: HEICO Corporation (HEI [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/HEI]), Sasol (SSL [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SSL]), Semtech (SMTC [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SMTC]), StealthGas (GASS [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GASS]), and more.\n\nTUESDAY, AUGUST 26\n\nOKTA (NASDAQ:OKTA [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/OKTA])\n\nOkta (OKTA [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/OKTA]) is scheduled to report its Q2 results after the market closes on Tuesday, with analysts forecasting robust performance. Expectations are for a 17% Y/Y increase in profits and more than 10% growth in sales.\n\nJust days ahead of earnings, Seeking Alpha’s Quant Rating upgraded Okta to Buy from Hold [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/OKTA/ratings/quant-ratings#source=firstLevelUrl%3Asymbol%7CbiSectionAsset%3ARatingSummary%7CbiName%3AQuant_rating], aligning with Wall Street analysts who also maintain a Buy rating.\n\nAccording to a Seeking Alpha contributor, Star Investments, Okta's valuation is particularly appealing [https://seekingalpha.com/article/4808675-oktas-growth-strategies-a-case-for-long-term-investment]. The company's price-to-free cash flow (P/FCF) multiple suggests a potential 27% upside from its July 31 closing price. This positive outlook is supported by Okta's consistent market leadership, as evidenced by its eighth consecutive year as a \"Leader\" in Gartner's 2024 Magic Quadrant. The company is also actively pursuing four key growth initiatives to ensure sustained revenue expansion over the medium and long term.\n\nAnother author, Roman Luzgin, highlights [https://seekingalpha.com/article/4807828-okta-fair-valuation-with-high-speculative-upside] additional factors that make Okta a compelling investment. He notes that the company's financial stability, low debt, and reasonable valuation ratios limit downside risk and create a favorable risk/reward profile. Furthermore, he suggests that recent acquisition rumors and sector-wide M&A trends could drive a significant premium, offering substantial speculative upside for Okta shareholders.\n\n \t* Consensus EPS Estimates: $0.85\n \t* Consensus Revenue Estimates: $711.84M\n \t* Earnings Insight: The company has consecutively outperformed EPS and revenue expectations in straight 8 quarters.\n\nALSO REPORTING: Bank of Nova Scotia (NYSE:BNS [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BNS]), MongoDB (NASDAQ:MDB [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MDB]), Bank of Montreal (NYSE:BMO [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BMO]), Box (BOX [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BOX]), Daqo New Energy (DQ [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/DQ]), EHang Holdings Limited (EH [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/EH]), and more.\n\nWEDNESDAY, AUGUST 27\n\nNVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NVDA])\n\nNvidia (NVDA [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NVDA]) is set to be the centerpiece of this week's earnings calendar, with its Q2 report scheduled for release after the market closes on Wednesday.\n\nAnalysts are forecasting ~50% Y/Y growth in both sales and profits, fueled by relentless demand for AI chips and accelerating data center momentum.\n\nWhile Wall Street analysts maintain a Strong Buy consensus, Seeking Alpha’s Quant system remains more cautious, rating NVDA a Hold [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NVDA/ratings/quant-ratings#source=firstLevelUrl%3Asymbol%7CbiSectionAsset%3ARatingSummary%7CbiName%3AQuant_rating] on valuation concerns.\n\nAdding to skepticism, SA contributor Bears of Wall Street reiterates a Sell [https://seekingalpha.com/article/4815643-nvidia-sell-before-its-too-late], warning that Nvidia’s renewed ability to sell H20 AI accelerators in China may provide only limited upside, given its overexposure to a handful of major customers and rising risk as hyperscale’s develop in-house AI chips.\n\nSimilarly, SA author Hawkinvest maintains a Strong Sell [https://seekingalpha.com/article/4814625-nvidia-is-8-percent-of-the-sp-500-index-history-shows-beast-mode-may-end], noting that while Nvidia is an exceptional company, its stock is “priced for perfection.” With NVDA trading at 40x earnings and 20x revenues, competition intensifying, and the stock now comprising 8% of the S&P 500, making it vulnerable to a pullback, particularly ahead of the earnings report.\n\n \t* Consensus EPS Estimates: $1.01\n \t* Consensus Revenue Estimates: $45.97B\n \t* Earnings Insight: Nvidia outperformed revenue and EPS estimates all the last 8 quarters.\n\nALSO REPORTING: CrowdStrike (NASDAQ:CRWD [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CRWD]), Snowflake (NYSE:SNOW [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SNOW]), HP (HPQ [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/HPQ]), Royal Bank of Canada (NYSE:RY [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/RY]), Veeva Systems (VEEV [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/VEEV]), Agilent Technologies (A [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/A]), Kohl's (NYSE:KSS [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/KSS]), Nutanix (NTNX [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NTNX]), NetApp (NTAP [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NTAP]), Pure Storage (PSTG [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/PSTG]), J.M.

Analysts expect a strong result with profit growth of more than 20% Y/Y on sales growth of near 17%.\n\nThe stock is up about 11% in 2025, and sentiment remains broadly bullish. Both Wall Street analysts and Seeking Alpha’s Quant Rating system assign it a Buy [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/DELL/ratings/quant-ratings#source=firstLevelUrl%3Asymbol%7CbiSectionAsset%3ARatingSummary%7CbiName%3AQuant_rating].\n\nSA Investing Group Leader Danil Sereda remains bullish [https://seekingalpha.com/article/4813586-dell-why-the-best-is-coming-q2-earnings-preview] on Dell (DELL [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/DELL]), noting the stock has doubled since his April call but still has strong AI server and PC refresh drivers. He sees Q2 earnings and potential guidance upgrades as catalysts, while partnerships with Nvidia and Elastic support a shift toward higher-margin, software-like revenue.

Analyst consensus points to approximately 4% Y/Y revenue growth but a 6% decline in profits, highlighting the mixed outlook.\n\nWall Street analysts remain bullish, assigning Alibaba a Strong Buy rating, driven by expectations of improved efficiency, expanding cloud margins, and steady e-commerce demand. However, Seeking Alpha’s Quant Rating system maintains a Hold [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BABA/ratings/quant-ratings#source=firstLevelUrl%3Asymbol%7CbiSectionAsset%3ARatingSummary%7CbiName%3AQuant_rating], reflecting lingering concerns around growth sustainability and macroeconomic risks.\n\nEnvision Research, a Seeking Alpha Investing Group leader, also holds a neutral stance [https://seekingalpha.com/article/4815439-alibaba-and-bridgewaters-china-exit]. The firm points to heightened systemic and geopolitical risks, citing the notable exit of Bridgewater Associates from US-listed Chinese stocks, including BABA. This factor, along with the suspension of the \"De minimis\" exemption, which poses threats to Alibaba's cross-border e-commerce business, is seen as largely offsetting the appeal of the company's low P/E and attractive PEG ratios. On a positive note, Envision Research does see promise for accelerated demand within Alibaba's cloud and AI segments.\n\nIn contrast, Andres Cardenal, another Seeking Alpha Investing Group leader, presents a Strong Buy argument [https://seekingalpha.com/article/4812079-alibaba-undervalued-ai-opportunity]. He contends that while Alibaba's decade-long underperformance underscores the risks of Chinese stocks, the current negative sentiment creates a compelling contrarian opportunity.\n\nCardenal highlights the company's aggressive \"all-in AI\" pivot, its leadership in open-source models, and its cloud growth, which position it as a top AI player in China. Despite competitive pressures, he notes that Alibaba remains highly profitable with strong financials and a valuation significantly below its global AI peers, suggesting an asymmetric upside, though active risk management is essential.\n\n \t* Consensus EPS Estimates: $2.15\n \t* Consensus Revenue Estimates: $35.32B\n \t* Earnings Insight: The company has beaten EPS estimates in 5 of the past 8 quarters, and revenue estimates in 4 of those reports.\n\n ALSO REPORTING: BRP (DOOO [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/DOOO]), Frontline (FRO [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/FRO]), Lanvin Group (LANV [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/LANV]), and more. \n\nMORE ON RELATED STOCKS:\n\n \t* Alibaba: Why This Could Be The Breakout Quarter (Earnings Preview) [https://seekingalpha.com/article/4815952-alibaba-stock-why-this-could-be-breakout-quarter-earnings-preview]\n \t* Nvidia: Sell Before It's Too Late [https://seekingalpha.com/article/4815643-nvidia-sell-before-its-too-late]\n \t* Dollar General: Why This Discount Retail Giant Is Poised For A Rebound [https://seekingalpha.com/article/4815495-dollar-general-why-this-discount-retail-giant-is-poised-for-a-rebound]\n \t* Ulta stands out within beauty category for tariff insulation, growth outlook -- Barclays [https://seekingalpha.com/news/4488275-ulta-stands-out-within-beauty-category-for-tariff-insulation-growth-outlook---barclays]\n \t* Nvidia chief praises TSMC, says buying its stock is 'very smart' [https://seekingalpha.com/news/4488203-nvidia-chief-praises-tsmc-says-buying-its-stock-is-very-smart]\n\n ",

Reference actual numbers in your reasoning.\n\n3. **Consistency**: Apply the same scoring standards regardless of the stock. A score of 85 should represent the same quality level across all analyses.\n\n4. **Risk Focus**: Pay special attention to red flags that could invalidate the opportunity (poor liquidity, imminent earnings, deteriorating fundamentals).\n\n5. **Strategy Alignment**: Consider how well this opportunity fits options strategies (directional bias, volatility conditions, time decay considerations).\n\n6. **Completeness Check**: If critical data is missing, note it in your analysis but don't penalize the opportunity excessively for data gaps.\n\nAnalyze the BABA opportunity now using this framework and respond with the required JSON format.",

            "title": "SpaceX aims to overcome Starship setbacks with tenth flight test",
            "content": "By Joey Roulette\n\nWASHINGTON (Reuters) -Elon Musk’s SpaceX will try to launch its giant Starship rocket for a tenth time from Texas on Monday to overcome a streak of development setbacks and achieve several long-sought milestones essential to the Mars rocket system’s reusable design.\n\nThe 232-foot (71-meter) tall Super Heavy booster and its 171-foot tall Starship upper half - together taller than New York’s Statue of Liberty - sat stacked on a launch mount at SpaceX’s Starbase rocket facilities ahead of a 7:30 p.m. ET liftoff time.\n\nA liquid oxygen leak at the Starship launchpad nixed a Sunday launch attempt, billionaire Musk wrote on X overnight, adding SpaceX would try again on Monday. It was unclear whether Musk intended to give a pre-launch Starship talk that had been planned but cancelled on Sunday.\n\nDevelopment of SpaceX’s next-generation rocket, key to the company’s powerful launch business and Musk’s goal to send humans to Mars, has faced repeated hiccups this year.\n\nNASA hopes to use the rocket as soon as 2027 for its first crewed moon landing since the Apollo program. SpaceX’s Starlink satellite internet business, a major source of company revenue, is also tied to Starship’s success. Musk aims to use Starship to launch larger batches of Starlink satellites, which have so far been deployed by SpaceX’s workhorse Falcon 9 rocket, into space.\n\n\"In about 6 or 7 years, there will be days where Starship launches more than 24 times in 24 hours,\" Musk said on Sunday, replying to a user on X.\n\nThis year, two Starship testing failures early in flight, another failure in space on its ninth flight, and a massive test stand explosion in June that sent debris flying into nearby Mexican territory have tested SpaceX’s capital-intensive test-to-failure development approach, in which new iterations of rocket prototypes are flown to their technical limits.\n\nThat ethos is markedly different from SpaceX’s rivals such as Jeff Bezos’ Blue Origin, whose New Glenn rocket made an operational debut in January following years of on-the-ground development and testing. The new Vulcan rocket from United Launch Alliance, co-owned by Boeing and Lockheed Martin , had a similar upbringing before its 2024 debut.\n\nWith SpaceX’s approach, testing failures early in Starship’s flight prevent the company from gathering vital technical data needed to advance the rocket’s design.\n\nStill, SpaceX, which Musk expects to record around $15.5 billion in revenue this year, has continued to swiftly produce new Starships for test flights at Starbase, a sprawling and rapidly growing rocket industrial complex. The area was made a municipality in May by local voters, many of them SpaceX workers.\n\nStarship’s setbacks underscore the technical complexities of the latest iteration. The ship is packed with far more capabilities than predecessor models such as increased thrust, a potentially more resilient heat shield and stronger steering flaps crucial to nailing its atmospheric reentry - key traits of its rapidly reusable design that Musk has long pushed for.\n\nSpaceX has a lengthy to-do list for Starship’s development before the rocket begins routine missions envisioned by Musk. That includes demonstrating safe returns from space, payload deployments in orbit and complex in-space propellant refuelings crucial to its moon mission assignments from NASA.\n\nOn Monday, the rocket system will launch from Texas and separate in half dozens of miles in altitude, with its Super Heavy booster returning for a water landing off the Texas coast while Starship ignites its own engines to blast further into space.\n\nIn space, Starship will attempt to deploy mock Starlink satellites and reignite an engine along its suborbital path around the globe. Atmospheric reentry over the Indian Ocean will test its exterior steering flaps and an array of experimental heat shield tiles as the ship blazes through intense friction and heat. </p>",

            "title": "Howmet vs. L3Harris: Which Aerospace &amp; Defense Stock Should You Bet On?",
            "content": "Howmet Aerospace Inc. HWM and L3Harris Technologies, Inc. LHX are two prominent names operating in the aerospace and defense industry. While Howmet is a leading manufacturer of components and systems for jet engines and airframes, L3Harris offers integrated technologies, including avionics, electronic systems, and command and control systems, in the United States and internationally.\r\n\r\nBoth companies have been enjoying significant growth opportunities in the aerospace and defense space on account of the improving air traffic trend and the expansionary U.S. budgetary policy. But which one is a better investment today? Let’s take a closer look at their fundamentals, growth prospects and challenges to make an informed choice.\n\nThe Case for Howmet\n\nThe strongest driver of Howmet’s business at the moment is the commercial aerospace market. The persistent strength in air travel has been driving demand for wide-body aircraft, in turn, supporting continued OEM spending. Pickup in air travel has been favorable for the company as the increased usage of aircraft spurs spending on parts and products that it provides.\r\n\r\nRevenues from the commercial aerospace market increased 8% year over year in the second quarter of 2025, constituting 52% of its business. The sustained strength was attributed to new, more fuel-efficient aircraft with reduced carbon emissions and increased spare demand for engines. The Boeing Company BA is also anticipated to witness a gradual production recovery, particularly in the Boeing 737 MAX aircraft, which is likely to boost demand for Howmet’s products in the market.\r\n\r\nHowmet is also benefiting from solid momentum in the defense business, cushioned by steady government support. HWM continues to witness robust orders for its engine spares for the F-35 program and other legacy fighters. Revenues from the defense aerospace market surged 21% year over year in the second quarter, constituting 17% of the company’s business.\r\n\r\nIt's worth noting that in July 2025, the House of Representatives passed the fiscal year 2026 Defense Appropriations Act, providing a total discretionary allocation of $831.5 billion. Such robust budgetary provisions set the stage for Howmet, which remains focused on its defense business to win more contracts, which is likely to boost its top line.\r\n\r\nHWM’s commitment to rewarding its shareholders through dividend payouts and share buybacks is also encouraging. In the first half of 2025, it paid dividends worth $83 million and repurchased shares for $300 million. In January 2025, the company hiked its quarterly dividend by 25% to 10 cents per share.\r\n\r\nAlso, in July 2024, Howmet’s board approved an increase in the share repurchase program by $2 billion to $2.487 billion of its common stock. As of July 2025, HWM’s total share repurchase authorization available was $1.8 billion.\r\n\r\nThe company’s shareholder-friendly policies are supported by its healthy liquidity position. Exiting the second quarter, Howmet’s cash equivalents and receivables were $545 million, much higher than its short-term maturities of $5 million. In the first six months of the year, HWM generated net cash of $699 million from operating activities, while its free cash flow totaled $478 million.\n\nStory Continues\n\nThe Case for L3Harris\n\nL3Harris is well-positioned to benefit from solid U.S. budget funding provisions. The company claims that its Hypersonic and Ballistic Tracking Space Sensor satellite, known as HBTSS, launched in February 2024, is the only proven on-orbit system capable of tracking the new-range hypersonic missiles. This should provide it with a competitive edge in becoming the primary contractor for the Golden Dome program.\r\n\r\nNotably, the company completed a $125 million expansion at its space manufacturing facility in Fort Wayne, IN, in April 2025, to support the Department of Defense’s urgent need for on-orbit technology to defend the homeland by building the “Golden Dome.”\r\n\r\nWhile the company boasts a solid position in the U.S. defense space, its international presence also remains significant. Evidently, during the second quarter of 2025, the company’s international revenues accounted for approximately 20.7% of its total revenues. L3Harris continues to witness strong demand for its defensive solutions from Asia-Pacific, Latin America and South America, as well as the NATO allies of the United States. \r\n\r\nDuring second-quarter 2025, L3Harris secured software-defined radio awards worth $181 million and $214 million, respectively, from the German and Czech armed forces. The company also signed a memorandum of understanding with Thales UK to develop an integrated short-range air defense (SHORAD) command and control capability.\r\n\r\nHowever, the company’s highly leveraged balance sheet remains a major concern. Exiting second-quarter 2025, L3Harris’ cash and cash equivalents amounted to $0.48 billion. On the other hand, its long-term debt of $10.98 billion remained much above the cash balance. Its current debt of $1.13 billion also came in higher than its cash reserve.\r\n\r\nPersistent shortage of labor in the aerospace-defense industry continues to pose a threat. Due to such labor shortages, manufacturing companies like L3Harris, which supply critical components for the aerospace and defense industry, might be unable to deliver the finished products within the stipulated timeline, which may impact their performance.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for HWM & LHX\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for HWM’s 2025 sales and earnings per share (EPS) implies year-over-year growth of 9.4% and 32.7%, respectively. HWM’s EPS estimates for both 2025 and 2026 have increased over the past 60 days.Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nWhile the Zacks Consensus Estimate for LHX’s 2025 sales indicates year-over-year growth of 2%, the EPS estimate implies a decline of 19.9%. LHX’s EPS estimates have been trending northward over the past 60 days for both 2025 and 2026.Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nPrice Performance and Valuation\n\nIn the past year, Howmet shares have soared 76.9%, while L3Harris stock has gained 20.4%.Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nHWM is trading at a forward 12-month price-to-earnings ratio of 42.42X, above its median of 28.18X over the last three years. LHX’s forward earnings multiple sits at 23.61X, above its median of 16.34X over the same time frame.Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nFinal Take on HWM & LHX\n\nL3Harris’ strength in the aerospace and defense markets has been dented by the continued supply-chain challenges and labor shortages. The company’s solid momentum in domestic and international markets adds to its strength. However, its high debt profile remains a major constraint.\r\n\r\nIn contrast, Howmet’s market leadership position and strength in both commercial and defense aerospace markets provide it with a competitive advantage to leverage the long-term demand prospects in the aerospace market. Despite its steeper valuation, HWM holds robust prospects due to strong estimates, stock price appreciation and better prospects for sales and profit growth.\r\n\r\nGiven these factors, HWM seems to be a better pick for investors than LHX currently. While HWM currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), LHX has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).\r\n\r\nYou can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

            "content": "Boeing recently entered advanced negotiations with Chinese officials for a potential sale of up to 500 aircraft, which would represent the largest order from China in years and mark a possible turning point in US-China trade relations. This prospective agreement could restore Boeing's commercial presence in the vast Chinese aviation market after an extended period of stagnation due to trade tensions. We’ll now explore how the possibility of this major China order could reshape Boeing’s outlook amid analyst expectations for recovery.\n\nOutshine the giants: these 20 early-stage AI stocks could fund your retirement.\n\nBoeing Investment Narrative Recap\n\nFor investors to consider holding Boeing stock, there needs to be confidence in the company’s ability to restore commercial aircraft deliveries at scale, capitalize on rising global air travel demand, and work through operational and financial setbacks. The recent news of advanced negotiations with China around a possible 500-aircraft order represents what many consider the most significant short-term catalyst, as breaking the sales drought in China could signal a material shift in Boeing’s commercial business. However, successful execution remains contingent on easing of trade tensions and resolution of ongoing certification delays, which still present the biggest operational risk to margin recovery and earnings sustainability.\n\nThe most relevant recent announcement to this high-stakes China development is the record-breaking Qatar Airways order for up to 210 aircraft, including 130 787 Dreamliners and 30 777-9s. This major order demonstrates ongoing demand for Boeing’s widebody jets from international carriers, reinforcing the company’s backlog and providing some visibility into future cash flows, two factors directly linked to the potential impact of the China deal as a near-term demand catalyst. Yet, translating these high-profile commitments into delivered aircraft and positive margins relies on overcoming persistent supply chain challenges and certification hurdles.\n\nBy contrast, investors should be aware that lingering technical and regulatory uncertainties around jet certification may still threaten Boeing’s path to...\n\nRead the full narrative on Boeing (it's free!)\n\nBoeing’s outlook anticipates $114.4 billion in revenue and $7.1 billion in earnings by 2028.

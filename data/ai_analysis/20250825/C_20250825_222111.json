            "title": "Fed Turns Dovish, Signals Upcoming Rate Cut: What This Means for Banks",
            "content": "At Jackson Hole, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell struck a more dovish tone, hinting that a rate cut could be on the horizon. He described the labor market as in a “curious balance,” wherein hiring is slowing and the pool of available workers is shrinking due to demographic shifts and the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown.\n\nMarkets were already betting on lower rates, with the policy range currently at 4.25-4.5%. Weakening job data has only strengthened those expectations. According to the CME FedWatch tool, nearly 87% of traders now see a 25-basis-point cut in September as the most likely outcome.\n\nStocks rallied on Powell’s remarks. During Friday’s trading session, the KBW Nasdaq Bank Index jumped 3.2%, the Dow Jones gained 1.9% and major banks advanced — Citigroup C up 2.9%, Bank of America BAC 2.5%, JPMorgan Chase JPM 2.1% and Wells Fargo WFC 1.6%.\n\nReasons for Signalling Rate Cut\n\nRising Risks in the Labor Market: Powell highlighted that while unemployment remains low, both hiring and labor supply are slipping, raising the risks of sudden layoffs or rising joblessness. Even a modest slowdown may trigger layoffs and rising unemployment, prompting the central bank to take a dovish stance to cushion the economy before those risks materialize.\n\nBalancing Inflation & Growth: While inflation remains above the Fed’s 2% target, Powell signaled a shift in priorities. Earlier in the tightening cycle, the Fed was willing to slow growth to bring prices down. Now, protecting jobs and sustaining economic momentum appear to outweigh the risk of inflation staying sticky. In effect, the Fed’s reaction function has turned more dovish, with greater sensitivity to weakening growth than to lingering price pressures.\n\nFinancial Conditions & Credit Flows: Beyond inflation and employment, elevated borrowing costs have strained both households and businesses, especially those with debt maturing after years of near-zero rates. Prolonged high interest rates risk dampening credit flows, stifling business investment and curbing consumer demand. By lowering rates, the Fed aims to ease financing pressures and prevent a slowdown in lending activity, which is critical to sustaining overall economic growth.\n\nHow Are Banks Likely to be Affected?\n\nThe Fed’s rate reductions, already totaling 100 basis points in 2024, have begun to stabilize funding costs, particularly deposit costs that had been rising during the tightening cycle. Any further rate cut will support net interest income (NII) expansion, a critical earnings driver for banks such as WFC, C, BAC and JPM. While lower benchmark rates can compress yields on loans and securities, the easing of funding pressures helps preserve margins.\n\nStory Continues\n\nLower rates also relieve financial stress for borrowers. Many households and businesses took on debt during the near-zero interest rate era and are now facing maturities at significantly higher costs. A rate cut makes refinancing more affordable, reducing the risks of defaults. This, in turn, can help banks improve credit quality and limit the need for higher loan-loss provisions.\n\nAlso, it is expected to encourage consumers and businesses to borrow. Such increased lending activity can result in larger profitability for banks as they earn more interest on these loans.\n\nDespite these positives, the full impact will not be immediate. Loan growth and improved asset quality take time to work through balance sheets, while margin compression may still weigh on near-term earnings. As a result, investors should expect a gradual rather than an immediate improvement in bank profitability.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

            "title": "Powell Hints at Policy Shift: Time to Load Up on JPM Stock?",
            "content": "On Friday, during his speech at Jackson Hole, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell signaled that a rate cut could come as early as September, citing rising risks in the labor market and easing inflation pressures. This marks a shift from the Fed’s “higher-for-longer” stance to a more flexible approach. Markets reacted positively, with equities rallying, and investors now expect at least a 25-basis-point cut in September and possibly another by year-end.\r\n\r\nAgainst this backdrop, let’s take a look at how JPMorgan’s JPM business will be affected.\n\nImpact of Rate Cuts on JPMorgan’s Net Interest Income (NII)\n\nJPMorgan’s balance sheet is highly asset-sensitive. Hence, the Fed rate cut will likely put downward pressure on the company’s NII. Lower rates will lead to reduced asset yields on variable-rate loans and securities, compressing margins unless deposits or funding costs reprice faster.\r\n\r\nNonetheless, management expects the near-term impact of rate cuts to be manageable, driven by robust loan demand and deposit growth. JPMorgan raised its 2025 NII guidance to almost $95.5 billion, highlighting continued strength but warning that further moves are “market dependent.” Earlier, the bank had guided NII to be approximately $94.5 billion for this year.\r\n\r\nJPM’s NII recorded a five-year (2019-2024) CAGR of 10.1%, mainly driven by the high-interest rate regime since 2022 and the acquisition of First Republic Bank in 2023. The trend continued in the first half of 2025, driven by solid loan and deposit growth and higher revolving balances in Card Services. \r\n\r\nSimilarly, JPMorgan’s close peers – Bank of America BAC and Citigroup C – are expected to witness a modest NII decline over the medium term when the central bank cuts interest rates. Both banks expect continued NII expansion in 2025, driven by strong loan demand and deposit growth. Bank of America projects NII to rise 6-7% in 2025, reaching $15.5-$15.7 billion in the fourth quarter, even as the Fed initiates rate cuts. Likewise, Citigroup expects 2025 NII (excluding Markets) to grow around 4%, indicating improved loan demand and higher deposit balances.\n\nHow Will JPM’s Non-Interest Income Be Affected by Lower Rates?\n\nThe shift toward easier monetary policy is expected to support client activity, deal flow and asset values. Thus, JPMorgan’s non-interest income streams will likely see meaningful upside. \r\n\r\nInvestment Banking (IB) & Advisory Fees: Lower borrowing costs will further support the revival of corporate financing activity, encouraging debt issuance, M&A and equity offerings. After a slow deal environment in the last two years, rate cuts are expected to spark a solid rebound in capital markets, boosting JPMorgan’s advisory and underwriting fees. The company continues to rank #1 for global IB fees, garnering a wallet share of 8.9% at the end of the first half of 2025. The healthy IB pipeline, an active M&A market and JPMorgan’s leadership position in the IB business ensure stronger growth once the macro situation changes.\r\n\r\nMarkets Revenues (FICC & Equities): Rate transitions often fuel volatility in fixed income, currencies and commodities. Thus, JPMorgan, with the industry’s leading trading desk, stands to gain from increased client hedging and speculative activity. Equities trading is also expected to benefit from higher volumes as investors reposition portfolios for a lower-rate environment. While structural normalization in trading activity is inevitable over time, JPMorgan’s broad product coverage across fixed income, currencies, commodities and equities positions it to capture upside during volatility spikes.\r\n\r\nWealth & Asset Management Fees: Declining yields typically push investors into equities and alternative assets. JPMorgan’s asset management business benefits from rising assets under management (AUM) and higher fee revenue as markets rally. Stronger sentiment is expected to drive inflows into the company’s private banking and wealth platforms.\n\nStory Continues\n\nRate Cuts & JPMorgan’s Asset Quality\n\nLower rates will likely support JPMorgan's asset quality, as declining rates will ease debt-service burdens and improve borrower solvency. The overall effect is expected to be moderate and vary by loan segment and macro conditions. Variable-rate consumer and leveraged corporate portfolios are likely to see the most direct benefit, reflecting the lower risk of near-term credit losses as rates fall.\r\n\r\nJPMorgan expects that anticipated Fed cuts will help stabilize or even modestly improve overall credit performance this year, especially in consumer and corporate loan books, as long as the U.S. economy remains resilient. Management anticipates the card net charge-off rate to be approximately 3.6% for 2025.\n\nOther Factors at Play for JPMorgan\n\nBranch Openings & Opportunistic Acquisitions: With 4,994 branches as of June 30, 2025, more than any other U.S. bank and a presence in all 48 contiguous states, JPMorgan continues to invest in brick-and-mortar to strengthen its competitive edge in relationship banking, despite the digital shift. In 2024, JPMorgan opened nearly 150 branches and plans to add 500 more by 2027 to deepen relationships and boost cross-selling across mortgages, loans, investments and credit cards.\r\n\r\nJPMorgan isn’t alone in branch expansion. Bank of America is growing its 3,664-center network, with 40 new openings last year and 110 more by 2027, despite most interactions being digital. \r\n\r\nAdditionally, JPMorgan has expanded through strategic acquisitions, including a larger stake in Brazil’s C6 Bank, partnerships with Cleareye.ai and Aumni, and the 2023 purchase of First Republic Bank. These moves boosted profits and supported its strategy to diversify revenues and grow digital and fee-based offerings.\r\n\r\nFortress Balance Sheet and Solid Liquidity: As of June 30, 2025, JPM had a total debt of $485.1 billion (the majority of this is long-term in nature). The company's cash and due from banks and deposits with banks were $420.3 billion on the same date. The company maintains long-term issuer ratings A-/AA-/A1 ratings from Standard and Poor’s, Fitch Ratings and Moody’s Investors Service, respectively.\r\n\r\nHence, JPMorgan continues to reward shareholders handsomely. It cleared this year’s stress test impressively and announced plans to increase its quarterly dividend by 7% to $1.50 per share. It also authorized a new share repurchase program worth $50 billion (became effective from July 1, 2025). \r\n\r\nIn March 2025, the company raised its quarterly dividend by 12% to $1.40 per share, while in September 2024, it announced a 9% hike in the quarterly dividend to $1.25 per share. In the last five years, it hiked dividends five times, with an annualized growth rate of 7.99%.\n\nSimilar to JPM, Bank of America and Citigroup have cleared the 2025 stress test. Following this, Bank of America raised its quarterly dividend 8% to 28 cents per share and authorized a new $40 billion share repurchase program, effective Aug. 1, 2025. Citigroup also announced a dividend hike of 7% to 60 cents per share. It is continuing with the previously announced buyback plan, which had $16.3 billion worth of authorization remaining as of June 30, 2025.\n\nTo Buy or Not to Buy JPMorgan Shares?\n\nSo far this year, shares of JPMorgan have soared 23.5% compared with a 9.8% rise for the S&P 500 Index. Meanwhile, Bank of America and Citigroup have gained 12.5% and 35.3%, respectively, in the same time frame.\n\nYTD Price Performance Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nFrom a valuation perspective, the stock appears expensive relative to the industry. The stock is currently trading at a forward 12-month price/earnings (P/E) of 14.80X. This is above the industry’s 14.65X, reflecting a stretched valuation.\n\nP/E F12M Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nAlso, JPM stock is trading at a premium compared with Bank of America and Citigroup. At present, Bank of America has a forward 12-month P/E of 12.17X, and Citigroup is trading at a forward 12-month P/E of 10.65X.\r\n\r\nFurther, earnings estimates for JPMorgan for 2025 and 2026 have been revised upward over the past month. The positive estimate revision depicts bullish analyst sentiments for the stock.\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for JPM’s 2025 earnings implies a 1.3% fall year over year owing to macro headwinds and higher non-interest expenses. Management anticipates non-interest expenses to be $95.5 billion this year, up from $91.1 billion in 2024. On the other hand, the consensus estimate for 2026 earnings suggests 4.5% growth.\n\nEarnings Estimates Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nWhile a September rate cut may trim JPMorgan’s lending margins, the overall shift toward easier monetary policy is likely to support client activity, deal flow and asset values, offsetting the pressure on NII and positioning the company for stronger non-interest revenue growth. \r\n\r\nWith a fortress balance sheet, robust capital returns and a proven ability to grow through acquisitions and branch expansion, JPMorgan remains the most resilient U.S. bank. Continued dividend hikes, a massive buyback program and upward earnings revisions reinforce its premium valuation and support the case for owning the stock.\r\n\r\nJPM currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

            "title": "Wall Street hires more senior bankers as growing confidence spurs deal rebound",
            "content": "By Tatiana Bautzer, Saeed Azhar and Isla Binnie\n\nNEW YORK (Reuters) -Wall Street banks have hired dozens of senior executives in recent months, as improved economic sentiment has spurred mergers and IPOs after a lull earlier in the year due to concerns over the effect of U.S. tariffs.\n\nThe surge in job-hopping, which typically occurs in the spring, illustrates how rising confidence has prompted banks to staff up to handle a wave of dealmaking.\n\n“It’s been an active summer in investment banking,\" said Troy Rohrbaugh, co-CEO of JPMorgan’s commercial and investment bank. \"But we’ve also been strategically hiring for the long-term in sectors and geographies where we think we can continue to grow share.”\n\nOn Friday, JPMorgan named industry veteran Jerry Lee as global chair of investment banking who will be joining from rival Goldman Sachs. The bank has recently added several senior bankers in technology, energy and activism defense and hired more than 300 bankers between January and April across its global banking unit.\n\n\"Just at the moment when hiring was really supposed to kick off, strong tariff uncertainty really shook the markets and shook a lot of these banks, and therefore they said ’Hey, let’s hold off’,\" said Meridith Dennes, managing partner at financial search firm Prospect Rock Partners. \"As the markets stabilized, hiring started to pick up in July.\"\n\nWall Street executives usually receive and consider job offers between January and April, weeks after receiving their yearly bonuses. But the 2025 hiring season was interrupted by the announcement of U.S. tariffs that President Donald Trump called \"Liberation Day.\"\n\nTalks for M&A and capital markets transactions froze. \"The tariffs put a hard stop on hiring and banks started to downsize,\" said Alan Johnson, founder of compensation consultancy Johnson Associates.\n\nIn June, as investment banking activity resumed, job openings that were on hold materialized, according to bankers and recruiters.\n\n\"There’s been no let up,\" Julian Bell, head of Americas at executive search firm Sheffield Haworth. \"We’ve been offering and closing on people all year without a pause and we’re still hard at it... it’s active across the market.”\n\nAmong the recent senior hires were Citigroup’s new co-heads of M&A, Guillermo Baygual and Drago Rajkovic, as well as Pankaj Goel, co-head for technology investment banking who all came from JPMorgan, hired by Citi’s head of banking Viswas Raghavan. Elsewhere, UBS added Taylor Henricks as its head of M&A in the Americas alongside a raft of other additions.\n\nAlthough recruitment improved after tariff-fueled freezing, it is still below more active years in the last decade, said Alan Johnson, founder of compensation consultancy Johnson Associates.\n\nWhile hiring for senior managing director positions has been steady, banks started hiring more junior staff in August, according to Tom Ragland, founder and CEO of financial services search firm the Harrison-Rush Group.\n\nHe reported a 200% increase in inbound and unsolicited messages from investment banks wanting associates and vice presidents -- typically early-career positions in banks -- in the week to August 13. This was a rebound from the first half of the year, when Ragland received 30% fewer hiring mandates for junior roles than in the same period of 2024.\n\nBoutique investment banks appear especially optimistic. Evercore announced late in July a deal to buy British boutique investment bank Robey Warshaw for $196 million. Evercore will now have more than 400 bankers in nine countries in Europe, the Middle East and Africa.\n\nLazard has hired 14 managing directors in 2025 as a way to reach the goal of doubling revenue by 2030, it said in July. Other areas that have been actively hiring are wealth management and private credit, according to Johnson Associates. Investment banking revenue was tipped to rise 20% this year before April, but that target is no longer achievable and banks are building up their teams for next year, Alan Johnson added.\n\nThe latest hiring decisions are backed by some deals getting closed, Dennes said.\n\n“A lot of folks had talked about building up a huge pipeline in the fourth quarter of 2024, and then subsequently, it was really tough to execute deals due to market uncertainty in the first half of 2025,\" she said. \"If you don’t have any deals closed, you don’t have any money to hire people,” she said. </p>",

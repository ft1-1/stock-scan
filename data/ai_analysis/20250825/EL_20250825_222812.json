            "content": "Second quarter earnings season is winding down, and with most of the reports in, the results have been mostly positive.\n\nOver 92% of S&P 500 index companies have reported results, and as of Aug. 18, analysts expected S&P 500 companies to report an 11% jump in earnings per share during the second quarter.\n\nCompanies had lower expectations to clear coming into the quarter — analysts expected S&P 500 earnings to rise 5% in Q2, the slowest pace of earnings growth since Q4 2023 — amid President Trump's tariffs, stocks' lofty valuations, and uncertainty about the health of the US economy.\n\nNvidia (NVDA) results on Wednesday, Aug. 27, highlight this week's earnings\n\nOther companies reporting include PDD Holdings (PDD), Alibaba (BABA), Okta (OKTA), Abercrombie & Fitch (ANF), CrowdStrike (CRWD), Five Below (FIVE), HP (HP), Kohl's (KSS), Snowflake (SNOW), J.M. Smucker (SJM), Urban Outfitters (URBN), Affirm (AFRM), Best Buy (BBY), Bath & Body Works (BBWI), Dick's Sporting Goods (DKS), Dell (DELL), Dollar General (DG), Gap (GAP), Petco (WOOF), Wolfspeed (WOLF), and Ulta (ULTA).\n\nMeanwhile, markets will continue to digest last week's commentary on the health of consumer spending from Walmart (WMT), Target (TGT), Home Depot (HD), and Lowe's (LOW).\n\nHere are the latest updates from corporate America.LIVE274 updates\n\n12 mins ago\n\nGrace O'Donnell\n\nShares of struggling chipmaker Wolfspeed rise as results are better than feared\n\nWolfspeed (WOLF) stock rose just under 1% in after-hours trading following its fiscal fourth quarter results. The struggling chipmaker has been navigating Chapter 11 bankruptcy and is in the midst of a restructuring, after delays in CHIPS Act funding further hampered the company's finances.\n\nWolfspeed reported a loss per share $4.30, compared to a loss of $1.39 per share during the same period a year ago. Revenue came in at $197 million, compared to $201 million the previous year. Wall Street analysts expected worse results.\n\n“Reflecting upon my first three months with Wolfspeed, I am more confident than ever in my decision to join the Company and our opportunity to further strengthen our position in the industry,” Wolfspeed's new CEO, Robert Feurle, said in a statement. “Our next important milestone is for the court to approve our Plan of Reorganization next month, and emerge from Chapter 11 shortly thereafter, with a much stronger financial structure.” Today at 11:47 AM UTC\n\nGrace O'Donnell\n\nPDD stock jumps after the Temu owner beat earnings estimates\n\nPDD Holdings (PDD) stock gained 7% in premarket trading on Monday after the Chinese e-commerce giant beat earnings estimates by a wide margin.\n\nThe Temu and Pinduoduo owner reported earnings per American depository share (ADS) of 20.75 Chinese yuan (approximately $2.89) compared to estimates of 12.30 yuan ($1.72), per S&P Global Market Intelligence estimates.\n\nRevenue rose 7% year over year to 10.4 billion ($1.45 billion), barely beating estimates as price competition with rivals Alibaba (BABA) and JD.com (JD) and higher costs from tariffs weighed on margins.\n\n“Revenues growth further moderated this quarter amid intense competition,” said Jun Liu, PDD Holdings vice president of finance. \"As we remain focused on long-term value creation, the sustained investments may continue to weigh on short-term profitability.”\n\nRead more here from Reuters Fri, August 22, 2025 at 8:51 PM UTC\n\nGrace O'Donnell\n\nNvidia to highlight next week's earnings\n\nSecond quarter results from Abercrombie & Fitch (ANF), Kohl's (KSS), and Best Buy (BBY) next week will continue to beat the drum of retail earnings after reports from America's big box stores, Walmart (WMT) and Target (TGT).\n\nBut it's Nvidia's (NVDA) earnings that will be the star attraction, as the AI chipmaker's stock has an 8% weighting in the S&P 500 (^GSPC).\n\nAs Yahoo Finance Senior Tech Editor Dan Howley writes, investors will be squarely focused on Nvidia's data center business — even more so since the company announced a new gigascale networking plan that will combine the performance of multiple data centers to create one massive GPU. And many will be eager to hear more about a new China chip Nvidia is developing with the Trump administration.\n\nHere's a look at next week's earnings calendar, marking a sort of grand finale for the second quarter reporting season:\n\nMonday: PDD Holdings (PDD)\n\nTuesday: BMO (BMO), MongoDB (MDB), Okta (OKTA), PVH (PVH)\n\nWednesday: Nvidia (NVDA), Abercrombie & Fitch, CrowdStrike (CRWD), Five Below (FIVE), HP (HP), Kohl's, Pure Storage (PSTG), Snowflake (SNOW), The J.M. Smucker Company (SJM), Urban Outfitters (URBN), Williams-Sonoma (WSM)\n\nThursday: Affirm (AFRM), Best Buy (BBY), Bath & Body Works (BBWI), Dick's Sporting Goods (DKS), Dell (DELL), Dollar General (DG), Gap (GAP), Marvell (MRVL), Petco (WOOF), TD Bank (TD), Ulta (ULTA)\n\nFriday: Alibaba (BABA) Fri, August 22, 2025 at 12:15 PM UTC\n\nGrace O'Donnell\n\nRoss Stores tops quarterly profit estimates as shoppers seek discount apparel\n\nReuters reports:\n\nRead more here. Fri, August 22, 2025 at 12:07 PM UTC\n\nGrace O'Donnell\n\nBJ's Wholesale Club stock falls as fuel prices weigh on sales\n\nFuel prices weighed on BJ's Wholesale Club (BJ) sales in the second quarter, the company reported Friday.\n\nOverall comparable club sales decreased by 0.3% year over year, while comparable sales excluding gasoline increased by 2.3% annually.\n\nThe company reported earnings per share of $1.14, topping Wall Street's estimates for earnings of $1.09 per share. Revenue of $5.38 billion in the quarter disappointed expectations for $5.48 billion, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence\n\nBJ's reiterated its full-year revenue guidance and narrowed the range for its earnings outlook. For fiscal 2025, BJ's sees comparable club sales minus gasoline increasing 2% to 3.5% year-over-year. Adjusted EPS is expected to range from $4.20 to $4.35 instead of $4.10 to $4.30 previously forecast. Thu, August 21, 2025 at 8:42 PM UTC\n\nGrace O'Donnell\n\nZoom stock pops as CEO attributes earnings beat to AI\n\nZoom stock (ZM) popped 5% on Thursday afternoon after the company reported a huge earnings beat.\n\nZoom posted earnings per share of $1.16, compared to Wall Street analyst estimates for $0.72, per S&P Global Market Intelligence. That represents 66% annual earnings growth.\n\nThe company's founder and CEO, Eric Yuan, noted that the strong quarter comes as artificial intelligence reshapes the way people are working. The company highlighted its paid add-on for custom AI agents that help with meeting prep and call summaries as drivers.\n\nRevenue rose 5% to $1.2 billion, bolstered by 7% growth in Enterprise revenue. The company's monthly churn rate remained flat year over year at 2.9%.\n\nZoom also raised its full-year revenue outlook and free cash flow guidance, which is now expected to be in the range of $1.74 billion to $1.78 billion.\n\nFor the full 2026 fiscal year, total revenue is expected to be between $4.825 billion and $4.835 billion while diluted EPS is expected to be between $5.81 and $5.84. Thu, August 21, 2025 at 8:26 PM UTC\n\nGrace O'Donnell\n\nWorkday to acquire AI company Paradox, stock falls\n\nWorkday (WDAY) stock slipped more than 3% in after-hours trading following the company's announcement that it would acquire Paradox for an undisclosed amount. Paradox is an AI company that uses AI chatbots to simplify the job application process.\n\nWorkday also reported second quarter results that beat expectations. Subscription revenue increased 14%, lifting overall revenue to $2.35 billion in the second quarter. Wall Street was looking for revenue of $2.34 billion.\n\nDiluted earnings per share of $2.21 beat estimates of $2.12 per share.\n\n\"Our second quarter results reflect the strength of our platform and our continued progress across several of our growth initiatives,\" CFO Zane Rowe said. \"Following our first half momentum — and also incorporating the acquisition of Paradox — we are increasing our fiscal 2026 subscription revenue guidance to $8.815 billion, representing growth of 14%, and increasing our fiscal 2026 non-GAAP operating margin guidance to approximately 29%.\" Thu, August 21, 2025 at 8:15 PM UTC\n\nGrace O'Donnell\n\nIntuit forecasts first-quarter revenue growth below estimates\n\nShares of Intuit (INTU), the company behind tax-preparation and finance software TurboTax, Credit Karma, and QuickBooks, fell 5% after hours after the company forecast fiscal first quarter revenue growth below analyst estimates.\n\nReuters reports:\n\nIntuit's board also approved a new $3.2 billion share buyback plan, raising its total repurchase authorization to $5.3 billion.\n\nRead more here. Thu, August 21, 2025 at 5:16 PM UTC\n\nGrace O'Donnell\n\nWalmart is still embarrassing Target\n\nWalmart (WMT) and Target (TGT) often get compared, especially when they report earnings back-to-back. But the most recent results from the big box stores highlight how the two couldn't be more different.\n\nYahoo Finance's Brian Sozzi dived into the two retailers' quarters:\n\nRead more here. Thu, August 21, 2025 at 2:25 PM UTC\n\nGrace O'Donnell\n\nWalmart CEO: Tariff impact has been 'gradual,' but we expect costs to increase\n\nWalmart (WMT) reassured investors that it's continuing to gain market share and generate healthy sales growth.\n\nBut even though executives said the company didn't see any \"dramatic shifts\" with consumer behavior last quarter, they did communicate that keeping costs low could become a greater challenge in the second half of the year as tariff-related price increases work their way through inventory.\n\n\"With regards to our US pricing decisions, given tariff-related cost pressures, we're doing what we said we would do: We're keeping our prices as low as we can for as long as we can,\" Walmart CEO Doug McMillon said on Walmart's earnings call.\n\n\"The way things have played out so far, the impact of tariffs has been gradual enough that any behavioral adjustments by the customer have been somewhat muted,\" McMillon continued. \"But as we replenish inventory at post-tariff price levels, we've continued to see our costs increase each week, which we expect will continue into the third and fourth quarters.\"\n\nListen to a replay of the earnings call here.

Wall Street analysts were expecting earnings per share of $3.64 on revenue of $2.85 billion.\n\nAfter a sluggish spring season in the housing market, there have been signs of a resurgence, with housing starts jumping in July. But mortgage rates that have barely budged, ongoing economic uncertainty, and affordability challenges for buyers continue to weigh on the sector.\n\nFor the quarter, Toll Brothers noted it had 2,388 units under signed contract, a 4% decline from a year ago. Analysts had expected orders growth.\n\n\"The average sales price of new contracts was $1.0 million, up 4.5% year-over-year,\" CEO Douglas Yearley said in the earnings release. \"Contract dollars were flat despite a 4% decline in units. While affordability pressures and uncertain economic conditions persist, we are pleased with the resilience of our luxury business and more affluent customer base.\" Tue, August 19, 2025 at 8:32 PM UTC\n\nGrace O'Donnell\n\nLa-Z-Boy stock drops on soft earnings and guidance\n\nLa-Z-Boy stock (LZB) dropped 16% in after-hours trading after the company missed earnings estimates and navigated \"soft industry demand.\"\n\nOverall, comparable sales dropped 1% to $492 million from a year ago. Sales in the furniture retailer's wholesale segment increased 1%, and retail sales rose 5%, but they were offset by weakness in the Joybird brand, which saw sales decline 14%.\n\nLa-Z-Boy reported diluted earnings per share of $0.44, compared to $0.61 per share a year ago. The Street was looking for earnings of $0.52 per share.\n\nLa-Z-Boy's guidance also came in lighter than expected. It expects sales in the range of $510 million to $530 million in the fiscal second quarter. Wall Street was looking for $532 million, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence. Tue, August 19, 2025 at 11:54 AM UTC\n\nMedtronic appoints 2 new board members, posts Q1 beat\n\nIrish medical device maker Medtronic (MDT) reported better-than-expected earnings for its fiscal first quarter on Monday.\n\nBut the bigger story was the company's announcement that it would add two new directors to its board after activist investor Elliott Investment Management became one of its largest shareholders.

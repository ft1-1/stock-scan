            "content": "US stocks ripped higher Friday after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell opened the door to a September rate cut during his speech at Jackson Hole — a dovish turn that lit a fire under speculative trades from meme stocks to crypto.\n\n\"The baseline outlook and the shifting balance of risks may warrant adjusting our policy stance,\" Powell said.\n\n\"Powell clearly opens the door for a September cut,\" Oxford Economics chief US economist Ryan Sweet wrote in a note. \"When Fed chairs open the door for a rate cut, it’s quite difficult to close.\"\n\nThat expectation helped ignite a broad risk-on rally, with some of the market’s most volatile corners leading the charge.\n\nOpendoor (OPEN), a debated Wall Street meme stock, surged nearly 40% as investors piled into housing-related names on expectations that lower borrowing costs could revive demand.\n\nCrypto and crypto-linked equities also roared back. Ethereum (ETH-USD) spiked 14% as of Friday afternoon, outpacing a 4% gain in bitcoin (BTC-USD).

Speculative/non-earners in growth sectors outperformed.\" Speculative growth names, particularly unprofitable tech companies, have surged since the April market bottom.Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell is seen walking in Grand Teton National Park on August 22, 2025 near Jackson Hole, Wyoming.

The broker, which aimed to \"democratize finance for all,\" faced intense scrutiny from regulators and customers alike. Many were critical of its \"payment for order flow\" business model, and there were even fears that the SEC would crack down and take away its primary revenue source.\n\nFast forward to today, and Robinhood has kick-started growth, enhanced its platform, and is pursuing several different initiatives to drive growth. The company has had a laser focus on adding customers and building a solid asset base. Since the end of 2022, its total platform has grown from $62 billion to $298 billion, as of July 31.\n\nImage source: Robinhood.\n\nThe company has done an excellent job of attracting customers to its platform, thanks to an appealing annual percentage yield (APY). One key to this is Robinhood Gold, its subscription service, which charges $5 per month or $50 per year.\n\nThis subscription service serves two purposes for Robinhood. For one, it provides the company with a steady stream of income, while customers get higher yields on their uninvested cash. Second, users who subscribe to Robinhood Gold have more assets and engage with the platform more frequently than non-subscribers.\n\nRobinhood's push into alternative financial markets\n\nThe company has attracted investors with its appealing APY. However, to continue growing, Robinhood is pursuing other avenues to continue to drive growth.\n\nFor one, it has upgraded its trading platform with Robinhood Legend, its browser-based platform. The company aims to attract active traders with its upgraded platform. It has also expanded its tradable products, including index options and futures.\n\nRobinhood is also providing customers with event-based contracts, another tradable product that aligns with the growing trend of betting markets.

This practice involves transforming traditional financial assets, such as equities and private investments, onto blockchain technology to increase efficiency and liquidity.\n\nOne of the recent announcements that stirred up discussion was its tokenization of OpenAI and SpaceX for European users, neither of which is publicly traded. The tokens track the private market valuations of these companies. \"These tokens give retail investors indirect exposure to private markets, opening up access, and are enabled by Robinhood's ownership stake in a special purpose vehicle,\" a Robinhood spokesperson said.\n\nIs Robinhood a millionaire-maker stock?\n\nRobinhood has done an excellent job of growing its platform and expanding its offerings for customers.

Powell saying, quote, the baseline outlook and the shifting balance of risks may warrant adjusting our policy stance. That fueled bets that the Fed could ease as soon as next month. Markets took that as a green light for risk. Meme darling, Open Door that jumped more than 30%, Ethereum spiked 13% outpacing a 4% gain in Bitcoin. And the enthusiasm spilled into some of those crypto linked names as well. Coinbase gained around 7%, Robin Hood up 4%, strategy up 6%. And this marks a sharp rebound after a pretty rough stretch for some of those high volatility plays. City strategist Scott Croner called the market reaction, quote, very positive, highlighting that a striking surge in small caps along with the equal weighted S&P 500 leading the headline index, it's really all incongruent a sign that the rally may be broadening beyond just Big Tech. Still Croner caution that there was some junkiness as unprofitable growth names also surge, but just really an overall risk on rally here amid Powell's dovish tilt. The question, of course now is whether this proves durable. Here's some of the reaction that we heard today following that speech.\n\n00:02:16 Speaker B\n\nI think he laid out the options in front of us by and not commit to anything. This is important. I know the markets think that he's committed, but I think at this point, there's a lot of uncertainty. I know that word's being used a lot, but the signals are mixed.\n\n00:03:02 Speaker C\n\nWhat Powell was trying to do today was to open the door to a rate cut in September. And what that does is that gives him a little bit insulation because if we get a really bad jobs report next month in early September, he can say, look, I opened the door to a move. Don't worry, we're on it. It's coming.\n\n00:03:53 Speaker D\n\nIn a way, maybe he's auditioning for the role of Fed chair. You know, if you look at the text of the speech, he actually completely removed the phrase that has characterized his entire term as Fed share of data dependent. Uh that wasn't in the speech and he's talking more about the balance of risks, looking ahead, and it was actually kind of refreshing to hear that.\n\n00:04:45 Speaker A\n\nNow, there is going to be a fair amount of data that will be released prior to this September decision. As you just heard, there's still some uncertainty related to the inflation side of the Fed's dual mandate. So we'll have to wait and see, but right now, market's clearly interpreting this as a rate cut in September, Josh.\n\n00:05:19 Josh\n\nAll right, Alex. Now, thank you.

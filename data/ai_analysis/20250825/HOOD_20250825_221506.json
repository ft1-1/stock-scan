            "title": "Insider report: The stocks with the biggest recent sales by executives from Circle Internet, Zillow, Applovin and more",
            "content": "A flurry of stock sales were made in names such as Circle Internet Group and Zillow Group last week as company executives and other corporate insiders offloaded their shares. Insider selling is followed by traders who expect the activity could point to deeper troubles at a company, though the motivations can vary. VerityData tracks the information, which is confirmed against the original Securities and Exchange Commission filings. The list excludes filings where the disclosure explicitly says the sale was conducted pursuant to preplanned 10b5-1 trading plans. Instead, the focus is on discretionary activity. Here are some of the most notable sales from the last week. Circle Internet Group CEO Jeremy Allaire sold 358,000 shares at an average price of $127.08 for a total of $45.5 million, according to regulatory filings . The sale reduced his holdings by 2%, and was made as part of the company's secondary offering . Circle , one of the earliest companies in the cryptocurrency industry, issues USD Coin, the second largest stablecoin in the world. Circle priced its IPO at $31, and shares shot up 168% on its first day of trading on June 5. Since then, the stock has been highly volatile. The secondary offering put pressure on the stock, and it has fallen more than 20% since it was announced on Aug. 12. Shares are trading 57% below the June high. CRCL 3M mountain Circle, over three months Zillow Group Zillow Group co-executive chairman and President Richard Barton sold 350,000 shares at an average price of $85.25 for a total of $29.8 million. The sale reduced holdings by 6%. What's more, co-executive chairman Lloyd Frink sold 250,000 shares at an average price of $85.00 for a total of $21.3 million. Barton and Frink sold outside their typical 10b5-1 trading plans, according to a note from Verity. Barton's last sale outside of a trading plan was 2017. Zillow shares are up nearly 25% quarter to date. Applovin Arash Adam Foroughi, chief executive at the mobile technology company, sold 178,000 shares at an average price of $418.78 for a total of $74.3 million. The sale reduced his holdings by 2%. Applovin shares are up 29% since the quarter began. Monolithic Power Systems Monolithic Power Systems CEO Michael Hsing sold 20,000 shares at an average price of $829.10 for a total of $16.8 million. The sale reduced his holdings by 2%. Verity notes this was a step-out sale after Hsing terminated a 10b5-1 trading plan, his first non-planned sales since 2019. Cardinal Health Cardinal Health CEO Jason Hollar sold 143,000 shares of the global health-care services and products company at an average price of $149.19 for a total of $21.4 million, securities filings show. The sale reduced holdings by 31.3%. Shares are slightly down, by 4%, over the past three months, but are up 24% year to date. . Verity notes a number of executives' sales coincide with stock award vestings: Eight executives, including CEO Jason Hollar, sold at $149.09 following vestings, a negative development as shares of the healthcare conglomerate have pulled back to levels within ~10% of their July all-time high. The activity marks the third such year that insiders have sold their post-vesting stock but this period stands out as it's accelerated each year at successively higher prices. CAH YTD mountain Cardinal Health, year to date Hollar led the activity as he sold 143,600 shares for $21.4 million, which compares with the 170,900 post-tax shares that vested days earlier, and leaves him with 27,300 shares retained from the vesting. CFO Aaron Alt sold 48,200 shares for $7.2 million, accelerating far above his post-vesting sale from last year and selling beyond the 42,800 post-tax shares that vested recently. While the CEO's sales were in line with his vestings, each of the others sold beyond the shares that vested this quarter, and that acceleration near the all-time high leaves us a bit cautious of Cardinal. Willdan Group Thomas Brisbin, director at Willdan Group , sold 125,000 shares of the the technical and consulting services firm to utilities companies, at an average price of $109.58 for a total of $13.7 million. The sale reduced his holdings by 28%. Verity noted that Chairman and former CEO Thomas Brisbin has led selling by four insiders in unusual multi-insider activity this quarter as shares of the technical and consulting services company have risen dramatically over the last several months, surging to new all-time highs. Willdan shares are up 126% over the past three months. Brisbin, who retired as CEO at the end of 2023, cut his non-option holdings by 28% with his sale at no less than $108 and he tacked on an option sale. He has routinely sold short-life options but his deviations to sell non-option shares have been timely, including a sale in November 2024 at $42.49 near a peak. Informatica Informatica CEO Amit Walia sold 508,000 shares of the enterprise cloud data management leader at an average price of $24.71 for a total of $12.6 million. The sale reduced his holdings by 20%. Shares are up about 10% over the past three months. Robinhood Robinhood CFO Jason Warnick, chief financial officer at the trading platform, sold 100,000 shares at an average price of $110.93 for a total of $11.1 million. The sale reduced Warnick's holdings by 16%. Shares are up almost 72% over past three months.",

He had dropped out of the University of Pennsylvania to establish Armor Labs, which another company later acquired.\n\n\"Crypto will be existential to Kalshi’s success just like it is for Robinhood (HOOD [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/HOOD]), Stripe (STRP), and Coinbase (COIN [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/COIN]),\" 23-year-old Wang wrote in an X article. \n\n\"Unlike others, Kalshi already has real penetration with mainstream users beyond crypto, strong financials with real paying customers, and structural liquidity advantages that attract Wall Street’s top market makers like SIG,\" he added. \n\nPolymarket, a blockchain-based prediction market rival, does not permit access for U.S. users. \n\nKalshi and Polymarket both saw a surge in popularity ahead of the U.S. presidential election in November. \n\nBloomberg first reported on Kalshi hiring Wang. \n\nMORE ON MARKETS\n\n \t* Kuaishou: Becoming Positive On AI Initiatives And Capital Return (Rating Upgrade) [https://seekingalpha.com/article/4816504-kuaishou-positive-ai-initiatives-and-capital-return-rating-upgrade]\n \t* OverActive Media Corp.

            "content": "Many of the same corporations that embraced remote work during the pandemic have been gradually calling people back to the office. Robinhood Markets (NASDAQ:HOOD) is the latest company to follow this trend, as CEO Vlad Tenev pulls back from a remote-first environment.\n\n\"Everyone said it was a one-way door, but it turns out it's a two-way door,\" Tenev said in a \"Cheeky Pint\" podcast episode. \"You can reverse pretty much anything.\"\n\nAs a part of Robinhood's updated RTO mandate, executives must now go into the office five days per week. Managers and individual contributors must report to the office four and three days per week, respectively.\n\nDon't Miss:\n\nThe same firms that backed Uber, Venmo and eBay are investing in this pre-IPO company disrupting a $1.8T market — and you can too at just $2.90/share. Kevin O'Leary Says Real Estate's Been a Smart Bet for 200 Years — This Platform Lets Anyone Tap Into It\n\nReturn To Office As A Downsizing Tool\n\nTenev's return-to-office mandate sparked a tidal wave of conversation on Reddit, with many people expressing their dissatisfaction that another big tech company was bringing people back into the office. One commenter mentioned that return-to-office mandates can be a way to mask layoffs.\n\n\"It’s bad press to lay off people. RTO is the new downsizing tool. It’s just a way to purge the rolls while AI takes the jobs,\" the commenter said.\n\nThe 2024 ZipRecruiter Annual Employer Survey backs up this argument. One of its conclusions was that companies that imposed RTO mandates reported annual turnover rates roughly 13% higher than companies that support remote work.\n\nTrending: An EA Co-Founder Shapes This VC Backed Marketplace—Now You Can Invest in Gaming's Next Big Platform\n\nRemote-First Has Worked For Robinhood\n\nTenev told \"Cheeky Pint\" host John Collison that he \"pretty much immediately\" regretted turning Robinhood into a remote-first company. Although a RTO mandate may make sense for a sinking ship, Robinhood stock has soared into another stratosphere.\n\nRobinhood's shares have almost tripled year-to-date, and it's not a meme bubble that's taking Robinhood stock to new highs. The fintech firm delivered 45% year-over-year revenue growth in Q2, while net income more than doubled year-over-year.\n\n\"We delivered strong business results in Q2 driven by relentless product velocity, and we launched tokenization— which I believe is the biggest innovation our industry has seen in the past decade,\" Tenev said in a statement accompanying Q2 results.\n\nStory Continues\n\nRobinhood's success as a company and its soaring stock price make it hard to say that the company's remote-first environment wasn't working.\n\nSee Also: The ECG Hasn't Changed in 100 Years — This AI Upgrade Could Help Detect Heart Disease Years Earlier\n\nDebates Emerge Over Robinhood's RTO Approach For Different Roles\n\nMany tech enthusiasts debated Robinhood's decision to have stricter RTO requirements based on an employee's role. Executives have to return to the office each weekday, while managers and individual contributors don't have to go to work as often.\n\n\"If you're an individual contributor and you're doing work, it's very nice to know that your manager is going through more pain than you,\" Tenev said in a Cheeky Pint interview.\n\nSome people cheered on the move, rationalizing that people who get paid more should go to the office more.\n\n\"So those who shoulder more responsibility are coming in more. What’s actually wrong here? This is the first sensible RTO policy I’ve ever seen. I’ve been a staunch critic of RTO in 99% of the cases,\" one Redditor said.\n\nHowever, another tech enthusiast said on Reddit that Robinhood's RTO mandate only sounds reasonable on the surface.\n\n\"It's reasonable in a false generosity/anchoring sort of way. Like when a store increases the cost of something just prior to a 50% sale to make it look like a good deal,\" the commenter said.\n\nRead Next: In a $34 Trillion Debt Era, The Right AI Could Be Your Financial Advantage — Learn More\n\nImage: Shutterstock\n\nUNLOCKED: 5 NEW TRADES EVERY WEEK.

The move would allow its customers to trade stocks on the blockchain.\n\nSimilarly, Robinhood Markets (HOOD [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/HOOD]) unveiled [https://seekingalpha.com/news/4463885-robinhood-beefs-up-crypto-push-with-tokenized-stocks-crypto-perpetual-futures-staking] U.S. stock and ETF tokens in the European Union, enabling eligible users to trade more than 200 digital versions of real company shares and ETFs on the blockchain.\n\nLater, OpenAI issued [https://seekingalpha.com/news/4465164-robinhood-ticks-lower-as-openai-rejects-tokenized-equity-tokens] a statement denying any affiliation with the tokenized equity offered by Robinhood, emphasizing that the tokens do not represent real ownership or equity in the company.\n\n\"We are alarmed at the plethora of brokers and crypto-trading platforms offering or intending to offer so-called tokenised U.S. stocks,\" the WFE reportedly wrote in the letter.\n\n\"These products are marketed as stock tokens or the equivalent to stocks when they are not,\" said the group representing the biggest stock exchanges.\n\nThe WFE noted that the companies whose stock is being mimicked could suffer reputational damage if the tokens fail, and regulators should apply securities rules to tokenised assets, according to Reuters.\n\n",

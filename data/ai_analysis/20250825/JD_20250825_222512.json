            "content": "Second quarter earnings season is winding down, and with most of the reports in, the results have been mostly positive.\n\nOver 92% of S&P 500 index companies have reported results, and as of Aug. 18, analysts expected S&P 500 companies to report an 11% jump in earnings per share during the second quarter.\n\nCompanies had lower expectations to clear coming into the quarter — analysts expected S&P 500 earnings to rise 5% in Q2, the slowest pace of earnings growth since Q4 2023 — amid President Trump's tariffs, stocks' lofty valuations, and uncertainty about the health of the US economy.\n\nNvidia (NVDA) results on Wednesday, Aug. 27, highlight this week's earnings\n\nOther companies reporting include PDD Holdings (PDD), Alibaba (BABA), Okta (OKTA), Abercrombie & Fitch (ANF), CrowdStrike (CRWD), Five Below (FIVE), HP (HP), Kohl's (KSS), Snowflake (SNOW), J.M. Smucker (SJM), Urban Outfitters (URBN), Affirm (AFRM), Best Buy (BBY), Bath & Body Works (BBWI), Dick's Sporting Goods (DKS), Dell (DELL), Dollar General (DG), Gap (GAP), Petco (WOOF), Wolfspeed (WOLF), and Ulta (ULTA).\n\nMeanwhile, markets will continue to digest last week's commentary on the health of consumer spending from Walmart (WMT), Target (TGT), Home Depot (HD), and Lowe's (LOW).\n\nHere are the latest updates from corporate America.LIVE274 updates\n\n12 mins ago\n\nGrace O'Donnell\n\nShares of struggling chipmaker Wolfspeed rise as results are better than feared\n\nWolfspeed (WOLF) stock rose just under 1% in after-hours trading following its fiscal fourth quarter results. The struggling chipmaker has been navigating Chapter 11 bankruptcy and is in the midst of a restructuring, after delays in CHIPS Act funding further hampered the company's finances.\n\nWolfspeed reported a loss per share $4.30, compared to a loss of $1.39 per share during the same period a year ago. Revenue came in at $197 million, compared to $201 million the previous year. Wall Street analysts expected worse results.\n\n“Reflecting upon my first three months with Wolfspeed, I am more confident than ever in my decision to join the Company and our opportunity to further strengthen our position in the industry,” Wolfspeed's new CEO, Robert Feurle, said in a statement. “Our next important milestone is for the court to approve our Plan of Reorganization next month, and emerge from Chapter 11 shortly thereafter, with a much stronger financial structure.” Today at 11:47 AM UTC\n\nGrace O'Donnell\n\nPDD stock jumps after the Temu owner beat earnings estimates\n\nPDD Holdings (PDD) stock gained 7% in premarket trading on Monday after the Chinese e-commerce giant beat earnings estimates by a wide margin.\n\nThe Temu and Pinduoduo owner reported earnings per American depository share (ADS) of 20.75 Chinese yuan (approximately $2.89) compared to estimates of 12.30 yuan ($1.72), per S&P Global Market Intelligence estimates.\n\nRevenue rose 7% year over year to 10.4 billion ($1.45 billion), barely beating estimates as price competition with rivals Alibaba (BABA) and JD.com (JD) and higher costs from tariffs weighed on margins.\n\n“Revenues growth further moderated this quarter amid intense competition,” said Jun Liu, PDD Holdings vice president of finance. \"As we remain focused on long-term value creation, the sustained investments may continue to weigh on short-term profitability.”\n\nRead more here from Reuters Fri, August 22, 2025 at 8:51 PM UTC\n\nGrace O'Donnell\n\nNvidia to highlight next week's earnings\n\nSecond quarter results from Abercrombie & Fitch (ANF), Kohl's (KSS), and Best Buy (BBY) next week will continue to beat the drum of retail earnings after reports from America's big box stores, Walmart (WMT) and Target (TGT).\n\nBut it's Nvidia's (NVDA) earnings that will be the star attraction, as the AI chipmaker's stock has an 8% weighting in the S&P 500 (^GSPC).\n\nAs Yahoo Finance Senior Tech Editor Dan Howley writes, investors will be squarely focused on Nvidia's data center business — even more so since the company announced a new gigascale networking plan that will combine the performance of multiple data centers to create one massive GPU. And many will be eager to hear more about a new China chip Nvidia is developing with the Trump administration.\n\nHere's a look at next week's earnings calendar, marking a sort of grand finale for the second quarter reporting season:\n\nMonday: PDD Holdings (PDD)\n\nTuesday: BMO (BMO), MongoDB (MDB), Okta (OKTA), PVH (PVH)\n\nWednesday: Nvidia (NVDA), Abercrombie & Fitch, CrowdStrike (CRWD), Five Below (FIVE), HP (HP), Kohl's, Pure Storage (PSTG), Snowflake (SNOW), The J.M.

Fri, August 22, 2025 at 12:07 PM UTC\n\nGrace O'Donnell\n\nBJ's Wholesale Club stock falls as fuel prices weigh on sales\n\nFuel prices weighed on BJ's Wholesale Club (BJ) sales in the second quarter, the company reported Friday.\n\nOverall comparable club sales decreased by 0.3% year over year, while comparable sales excluding gasoline increased by 2.3% annually.\n\nThe company reported earnings per share of $1.14, topping Wall Street's estimates for earnings of $1.09 per share. Revenue of $5.38 billion in the quarter disappointed expectations for $5.48 billion, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence\n\nBJ's reiterated its full-year revenue guidance and narrowed the range for its earnings outlook. For fiscal 2025, BJ's sees comparable club sales minus gasoline increasing 2% to 3.5% year-over-year. Adjusted EPS is expected to range from $4.20 to $4.35 instead of $4.10 to $4.30 previously forecast. Thu, August 21, 2025 at 8:42 PM UTC\n\nGrace O'Donnell\n\nZoom stock pops as CEO attributes earnings beat to AI\n\nZoom stock (ZM) popped 5% on Thursday afternoon after the company reported a huge earnings beat.\n\nZoom posted earnings per share of $1.16, compared to Wall Street analyst estimates for $0.72, per S&P Global Market Intelligence. That represents 66% annual earnings growth.\n\nThe company's founder and CEO, Eric Yuan, noted that the strong quarter comes as artificial intelligence reshapes the way people are working. The company highlighted its paid add-on for custom AI agents that help with meeting prep and call summaries as drivers.\n\nRevenue rose 5% to $1.2 billion, bolstered by 7% growth in Enterprise revenue. The company's monthly churn rate remained flat year over year at 2.9%.\n\nZoom also raised its full-year revenue outlook and free cash flow guidance, which is now expected to be in the range of $1.74 billion to $1.78 billion.\n\nFor the full 2026 fiscal year, total revenue is expected to be between $4.825 billion and $4.835 billion while diluted EPS is expected to be between $5.81 and $5.84. Thu, August 21, 2025 at 8:26 PM UTC\n\nGrace O'Donnell\n\nWorkday to acquire AI company Paradox, stock falls\n\nWorkday (WDAY) stock slipped more than 3% in after-hours trading following the company's announcement that it would acquire Paradox for an undisclosed amount. Paradox is an AI company that uses AI chatbots to simplify the job application process.\n\nWorkday also reported second quarter results that beat expectations. Subscription revenue increased 14%, lifting overall revenue to $2.35 billion in the second quarter. Wall Street was looking for revenue of $2.34 billion.\n\nDiluted earnings per share of $2.21 beat estimates of $2.12 per share.\n\n\"Our second quarter results reflect the strength of our platform and our continued progress across several of our growth initiatives,\" CFO Zane Rowe said. \"Following our first half momentum — and also incorporating the acquisition of Paradox — we are increasing our fiscal 2026 subscription revenue guidance to $8.815 billion, representing growth of 14%, and increasing our fiscal 2026 non-GAAP operating margin guidance to approximately 29%.\" Thu, August 21, 2025 at 8:15 PM UTC\n\nGrace O'Donnell\n\nIntuit forecasts first-quarter revenue growth below estimates\n\nShares of Intuit (INTU), the company behind tax-preparation and finance software TurboTax, Credit Karma, and QuickBooks, fell 5% after hours after the company forecast fiscal first quarter revenue growth below analyst estimates.\n\nReuters reports:\n\nIntuit's board also approved a new $3.2 billion share buyback plan, raising its total repurchase authorization to $5.3 billion.\n\nRead more here.

But the most recent results from the big box stores highlight how the two couldn't be more different.\n\nYahoo Finance's Brian Sozzi dived into the two retailers' quarters:\n\nRead more here. Thu, August 21, 2025 at 2:25 PM UTC\n\nGrace O'Donnell\n\nWalmart CEO: Tariff impact has been 'gradual,' but we expect costs to increase\n\nWalmart (WMT) reassured investors that it's continuing to gain market share and generate healthy sales growth.\n\nBut even though executives said the company didn't see any \"dramatic shifts\" with consumer behavior last quarter, they did communicate that keeping costs low could become a greater challenge in the second half of the year as tariff-related price increases work their way through inventory.\n\n\"With regards to our US pricing decisions, given tariff-related cost pressures, we're doing what we said we would do: We're keeping our prices as low as we can for as long as we can,\" Walmart CEO Doug McMillon said on Walmart's earnings call.\n\n\"The way things have played out so far, the impact of tariffs has been gradual enough that any behavioral adjustments by the customer have been somewhat muted,\" McMillon continued. \"But as we replenish inventory at post-tariff price levels, we've continued to see our costs increase each week, which we expect will continue into the third and fourth quarters.\"\n\nListen to a replay of the earnings call here.

Wall Street analysts were expecting earnings per share of $3.64 on revenue of $2.85 billion.\n\nAfter a sluggish spring season in the housing market, there have been signs of a resurgence, with housing starts jumping in July. But mortgage rates that have barely budged, ongoing economic uncertainty, and affordability challenges for buyers continue to weigh on the sector.\n\nFor the quarter, Toll Brothers noted it had 2,388 units under signed contract, a 4% decline from a year ago. Analysts had expected orders growth.\n\n\"The average sales price of new contracts was $1.0 million, up 4.5% year-over-year,\" CEO Douglas Yearley said in the earnings release. \"Contract dollars were flat despite a 4% decline in units. While affordability pressures and uncertain economic conditions persist, we are pleased with the resilience of our luxury business and more affluent customer base.\" Tue, August 19, 2025 at 8:32 PM UTC\n\nGrace O'Donnell\n\nLa-Z-Boy stock drops on soft earnings and guidance\n\nLa-Z-Boy stock (LZB) dropped 16% in after-hours trading after the company missed earnings estimates and navigated \"soft industry demand.\"\n\nOverall, comparable sales dropped 1% to $492 million from a year ago. Sales in the furniture retailer's wholesale segment increased 1%, and retail sales rose 5%, but they were offset by weakness in the Joybird brand, which saw sales decline 14%.\n\nLa-Z-Boy reported diluted earnings per share of $0.44, compared to $0.61 per share a year ago. The Street was looking for earnings of $0.52 per share.\n\nLa-Z-Boy's guidance also came in lighter than expected. It expects sales in the range of $510 million to $530 million in the fiscal second quarter. Wall Street was looking for $532 million, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence.

Analysts see the chipmaker posting earnings of $1.01 per share on $46.13 billion in revenue. Price targets have been climbing in the lead-up, reflecting optimism that demand for AI hardware remains high.\n\nNvidia stock has already had a monster run: Shares are sitting near a record high, up 32% year to date, while nearly doubling since April’s market low. Wednesday’s report acts as a litmus test for Nvidia as well as the broader market, as investors eyed a potential rotation out of tech before the end-of-week rally. Meanwhile, Dell (DELL) and Marvell Technology (MRVL) report on Thursday.\n\nLooking ahead, the spotlight turns to Friday’s July PCE inflation report, the Fed's preferred inflation gauge. Economists expect core PCE to rise 2.9% year over year, slightly higher than June’s 2.8%.LIVE15 updates\n\n25 mins ago\n\nGrace O'Donnell\n\nUS new home sales fall in July\n\nReuters reports:\n\nRead more here.

JDE Peet's stock surged on the news, up nearly 18%.\n\nBy the end of 2026, Keurig Dr Pepper will spin off into two publicly listed companies, Beverage Co. and Global Coffee Co., a pure-play coffee brand.\n\nThe beverage-focused company will include energy drinks C3 and Ghost, alongside juice and soda brands like Mott's and Canada Dry, while Global Coffee Co will have JDE Peet's and Keurig, among others. This essentially unravels Keurig's 2018 acquisition of Dr Pepper Snapple.\n\nThe company's US coffee business has been under pressure. Volume for its US coffee business is expected to decline 5.92% in the coming quarter, per Bloomberg consensus data, while its beverage business is expected to see continued growth.\n\n\"Global Coffee Co. will be able to optimize its operating and growth model to singularly focus on coffee greater consumer focus, sharper execution, fit-for-purpose growth opportunities,\" CEO Timothy Cofer, who will be the CEO of Beverage Co. following the split, told investors on a call.\n\nHe added that, \"as a pure play, I think the business [Beverage Co.] will benefit from even greater strategic clarity than what was possible as part of KDP.\"\n\nLately, big food companies have faced questions about their futures and are taking a hard look at their US portfolios as consumer tastes shift, growth stalls, and regulatory scrutiny of products continues. Recent announcements include a potential breakup at Kraft Heinz (KHC), a multibillion-dollar deal between Ferrero and WK Kellogg (KLG), and PepsiCo's (PEP) acquisition of soda brand Poppi.\n\n\"The self-reflection is building,\" Mizuho analyst John Baumgartner told Yahoo Finance earlier this summer, \"there's a lot of flux in the industry right now.\" Today at 1:37 PM UTC\n\nGrace O'Donnell\n\nStocks fall at the open\n\nUS stocks retreated on Monday morning from their surge on Friday on the heels of Fed Chair Jerome Powell's Jackson Hole speech.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) and the S&P 500 (^GSPC) both fell around 0.2% at the open.

Including the $2.2 billion CHIPS Act grant Intel has already received, the deal puts the government's investment in Intel at $11.1 billion.\n\nTrump's post on Monday comes about an hour after Kevin Hassett, the director of the National Economic Council, that the administration will continue to look to make similar investments across industries.\n\nIn an interview on CNBC, Hassett said, \"the president has made it clear all the way back to the campaign, he thinks that in the end, it would be great if the US could start to build up a sovereign wealth fund.\n\n\"So I’m sure that at some point there’ll be more transactions, if not in this industry then other industries.\n\nOn Friday, Intel stock rose 5% on reports the government was preparing to take a 10% stake in the chipmaker, which has fallen behind its peers during the AI boom. Shares slipped about 1.5% in late trading after details of the deal were announced.\n\n\"President Trump’s focus on U.S. chip manufacturing is driving historic investments in a vital industry that is integral to the country’s economic and national security,\" Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan said in a statement on Friday.\n\n\"We are grateful for the confidence the President and the Administration have placed in Intel, and we look forward to working to advance U.S. technology and manufacturing leadership.\"\n\nRead more here.

Ethan Allen (ETD) and La-Z-Boy (LZB) stocks got a lift, as the two furniture companies produce a significant portion of their items in the US. Ethan Allen rose 5%, while La-Z-Boy added nearly 2%.

Shares spiked as much as 12% earlier but pared gains as investors digested the report.\n\nThe Temu and Pinduoduo owner reported earnings per American depository share (ADS) of 20.75 Chinese yuan (approximately $2.89) compared to estimates of 12.30 yuan ($1.72), per S&P Global Market Intelligence estimates.\n\nRevenue rose 7% year over year to 10.4 billion ($1.45 billion), barely beating estimates as price competition with rivals Alibaba (BABA) and JD.com (JD) and higher costs from tariffs weighed on margins. US-listed shares of Alibaba and JD.com also rose ahead of the market open.\n\n“Revenues growth further moderated this quarter amid intense competition,” said Jun Liu, PDD Holdings vice president of finance. \"As we remain focused on long-term value creation, the sustained investments may continue to weigh on short-term profitability.”\n\nRead more here from Reuters Today at 11:47 AM UTC\n\nKaren Friar\n\nCanadians load up on US stocks despite Trump's trade war\n\nUS President Donald Trump’s tariffs, threats of annexation and assorted insults have infuriated Canadians, leading them to sell off American real estate and boycott products.\n\nThe nation’s investors seemingly never got the memo, Bloomberg reports:\n\nRead more here.

Today at 9:05 AM UTC\n\nBrian Sozzi\n\nIntel and the US government\n\nIntel (INTC) shares are up slightly in premarket trading on the late Friday news the US government is taking a 10% stake in the chip giant.\n\nThe deal is getting mostly favorable reviews on the Street, in part because the government isn't getting a board seat and the terms aren't super restrictive.\n\nEven still, it's not an ideal situation for Intel. Now CEO Lip-Bu Tan has to have the Trump administration breathing down his neck at every corner while he attempts to save the company.\n\nAnd make no mistake, with this government investment, it's a signal that Intel needs saving.\n\nWhat KeyBanc had to say:\n\n\"We see positive implications associated with this transaction as we were previously concerned that the U.S. government's equity stake would likely have other Intel obligations with a potentially activist ownership role. Additionally, with the removal of the clawback on the previous CHIPS Act grant and announced equity transaction, uncertainty associated with whether INTC's Chips Act funding would be reneged is off the table.\" Today at 8:45 AM UTC\n\nKaren Friar\n\nThis week's Nvidia earnings, PCE inflation pose tests with stocks near records\n\nYahoo Finance's Josh Schafer lays out the potentially market-moving events to watch this week, after stocks ended last week in rally mode, thanks to Fed Chair Jerome Powell's comments.\n\nSchafer reports:\n\nRead more here.

Reference actual numbers in your reasoning.\n\n3. **Consistency**: Apply the same scoring standards regardless of the stock. A score of 85 should represent the same quality level across all analyses.\n\n4. **Risk Focus**: Pay special attention to red flags that could invalidate the opportunity (poor liquidity, imminent earnings, deteriorating fundamentals).\n\n5. **Strategy Alignment**: Consider how well this opportunity fits options strategies (directional bias, volatility conditions, time decay considerations).\n\n6. **Completeness Check**: If critical data is missing, note it in your analysis but don't penalize the opportunity excessively for data gaps.\n\nAnalyze the JD opportunity now using this framework and respond with the required JSON format.",

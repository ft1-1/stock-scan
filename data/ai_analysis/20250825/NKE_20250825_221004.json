Of the 22 guru strategies we follow,  NKE rates highest using our P/B Growth Investor model based on the published strategy of Partha Mohanram. This growth model looks for low book-to-market stocks that exhibit characteristics associated with sustained future growth.\n\nNIKE INC (NKE) is a large-cap growth stock in the Footwear industry. The rating using this strategy is 88% based on the firm’s underlying fundamentals and the stock’s valuation. A score of 80% or above typically indicates that the strategy has some interest in the stock and a score above 90% typically indicates strong interest.\n\nThe following table summarizes whether the stock meets each of this strategy's tests.

Sometimes research that changes the investing world can come from the halls of academia. Partha Mohanram is a great example of this. While academic research has shown that value investing works over time, it has found the opposite for growth investing. Mohanram turned that research on its head by developing a growth model that produced significant market outperformance. His research paper \"Separating Winners from Losers among Low Book-to-Market Stocks using Financial Statement Analysis\" looked at the criteria that can be used to separate growth stocks that continue their upward trajectory from those that don't. Mohanram is currently the John H.

            "title": "A Fresh Look at Nike (NKE) Valuation After Recent Share Price Move",
            "content": "NIKE (NKE) shares just notched a 2.9% jump in the last trading session, an upward move that may have caught the attention of investors following the stock’s recent pattern of muted returns. While there hasn’t been a headline-grabbing event or major announcement to explain the latest spike, even relatively quiet days like this can spark renewed interest, especially when the broader market is weighing the future trajectory of consumer-focused names like NIKE. The movement might simply reflect shifting market sentiment or some investors seeing new value at current prices.\n\nLooking at the bigger picture, the past year has been a choppy one for NIKE. While the stock has added about 6% so far in 2024, this comes after a 4.7% decline over the last twelve months, and a drop of 24% across three years. Momentum has perked up lately, as shares have gained more than 30% in the past three months. This suggests some buyers are willing to look past the stumbles and reconsider the valuation story. Both revenue and net income have shown annual growth, supporting that recovery narrative, even as long-term investors are still in the red compared to previous highs.\n\nThis latest move raises a familiar question for investors, though: Is there real upside left in NIKE, or is the market finally factoring in every bit of potential future growth?\n\nMost Popular Narrative: 10.8% Undervalued\n\nAccording to the narrative provided by Unike, Nike's valuation appears to offer some upside, with the stock considered around 11% below fair value when weighed against its future growth potential and profitability improvements.\n\nWhere Will Nike Be in 5 Years? Nike will likely remain the dominant global sportswear brand, but it faces increasing competition. Revenue growth will depend on its ability to scale DTC, innovate in performance and lifestyle, and expand internationally.\n\nCraving the inside story on why Nike's numbers suggest hidden value? This narrative centers on bold profit forecasts, ambitious sales expansion, and a future multiple that is comparable to industry leaders. Interested in seeing the complete playbook behind this valuation? Keep reading to uncover which assumptions drive Unike's view.\n\nResult: Fair Value of $87.9 (UNDERVALUED)\n\nHave a read of the narrative in full and understand what's behind the forecasts.\n\nHowever, rising competition from brands like Hoka and On Running, as well as weakening sales in China, could challenge Nike's recovery case going forward.\n\nFind out about the key risks to this NIKE narrative.\n\nAnother View: Our DCF Model Tells a Different Story\n\nWhile one approach points to hidden value, our DCF model presents a less optimistic picture and suggests NIKE may actually be trading above its fair value. Which method should investors trust when the signals diverge?\n\nStory Continues\n\nLook into how the SWS DCF model arrives at its fair value.NKE Discounted Cash Flow as at Aug 2025\n\nSimply Wall St performs a discounted cash flow (DCF) on every stock in the world every day (check out NIKE for example).

Reference actual numbers in your reasoning.\n\n3. **Consistency**: Apply the same scoring standards regardless of the stock. A score of 85 should represent the same quality level across all analyses.\n\n4. **Risk Focus**: Pay special attention to red flags that could invalidate the opportunity (poor liquidity, imminent earnings, deteriorating fundamentals).\n\n5. **Strategy Alignment**: Consider how well this opportunity fits options strategies (directional bias, volatility conditions, time decay considerations).\n\n6. **Completeness Check**: If critical data is missing, note it in your analysis but don't penalize the opportunity excessively for data gaps.\n\nAnalyze the NKE opportunity now using this framework and respond with the required JSON format.",

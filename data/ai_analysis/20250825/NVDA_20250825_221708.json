            "content": "(Reuters) -The Utah Office of Energy Development, TerraPower and land development firm Flagship Companies signed an agreement on Monday to explore sites for a nuclear reactor project and an energy storage plant amid soaring demand for power.\n\nThe parties said they expect to make recommendations for a site by the end of the year.\n\nU.S. nuclear power is experiencing a renaissance after decades of stagnation, driven by record demand from data centers used for artificial intelligence technologies and the electrification of industries such as transportation and manufacturing.\n\nThe agreement also supports Utah Governor Spencer J. Cox’s Operation Gigawatt, a strategic effort to build an energy ecosystem that serves Utah and the Western U.S., the companies said in a statement.\n\nPresident Donald Trump signed executive orders in late May, directing the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission to cut down on regulations and fast-track new licenses for reactors and power plants.\n\nIn June, TerraPower had raised $650 million in a funding round that included founder Bill Gates and the venture capital arm of chipmaker Nvidia, and said it expects to get regulatory approval for its $4 billion nuclear reactor next year.\n\nThe company’s $4-billion Natrium nuclear reactor is located in Wyoming on the site of an old coal plant.\n\nBellevue, Washington-based TerraPower has been developing an advanced nuclear reactor that uses liquid sodium as a coolant instead of water.\n\nThe Natrium reactor has the added benefit of using significantly less water than the current light water reactor fleet and small modular reactor designs, making it well suited for water-constrained regions, the company said in statement.",

A new BestBrokers analysis suggests the social media giant, now worth about $1.88T, could more than double its value and hit that milestone by February 2027.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 5 Warning Sign with META. Is META fairly valued? Test your thesis with our free DCF calculator.\n\nThe call comes on the heels of Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) both crossing $4 trillion, cementing how much AI enthusiasm has reshaped tech valuations. Analyst Paul Hoffman said Meta's big swing into AI-driven tools and the metaverse is reviving investor confidence, while advertising still provides steady cash.\n\nBroadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) is also in the chase, with forecasts pointing to a $4 trillion valuation by May 2027 as demand for its AI and data center chips skyrockets. Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and TSMC (NYSE:TSM) are seen reaching the mark in 2028, while Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) are expected later in the decade.\n\nCloser to $1 trillion, JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM), Walmart (NYSE:WMT), and Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) are knocking on the door. High-growth names like Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Palantir (NASDAQ:PLTR) are also surprising contenders, with Palantir's pace suggesting it could leap much faster than expected.\n\nFor investors, the bigger picture is clear: the $4 trillion race isn't just about bragging rightsit's about which sectors are pulling capital, and right now AI, chips, and digital platforms are winning.\n\nView Comments",

            "title": "Nvidia earnings: How big of a risk is China uncertainty?",
            "content": "Nvidia (NVDA) reports earnings on Wednesday after the closing bell, potentially offering investors more insight into the impact of recent regulatory changes on its China sales. The artificial intelligence (AI) chipmaker has agreed to pay the US government 15% of the revenue from selling its products in China, reversing earlier Trump administration rules that prohibited Nvidia from selling in China.\n\nD.A. Davidson head of technology research Gil Luria explains how he's thinking about this risk.\n\nTune in to Yahoo Finance on Wednesday, Aug. 27 at 4 p.m. for special coverage of Nvidia's quarterly results, followed by an exclusive interview with Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang.\n\nTo watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Market Domination.\n\nVideo Transcript\n\n00:00 Speaker A\n\nWhen Nvidia reports second-quarter earnings Wednesday, Yahoo Finance will cover the earnings and the call live in special coverage followed by an interview with CEO Jensen Huang. The report comes amid a flurry of moves between the company and the Trump administration with Trump revoking his prior ban on the sale of chips to China. But his administration will now require the AI giant to pay the government a 15% cut of sales in China. Here with more, we got Gil Luria, DA Davidson head of technology research. Gil, it is great to see you as always. So, uh listen, Nvidia earnings on deck, Gil. I'm curious what you expect to hear. We did hear from those big tech giants recently, Gil, who said, listen, they're going to keep spending, spending, spending on AI capex. That should be good news for Jensen Huang's company, no?\n\n01:54 Gil Luria\n\nIt is good news. And and more broadly speaking, the fact that the AI tools have gotten so good and that we're all using them so much more for more things tells us that we're going to need more compute. If we need more compute, we're going to need more data centers, we're going to need more GPUs. Big picture, that's all that's really important for Nvidia, and that'll be reflected in this quarter. There are complications around the relationship with China, but it's not going to go away anytime soon. The news flow there is daily, but big picture is still very positive for Nvidia.\n\n03:00 Speaker A\n\nYou do mention, Gil, the sort of cross currents here with with China, lots of headlines. If I'm an investor in Nvidia, Gil, do I just have to simply bet, okay, CEO Jensen Huang, not only a gifted executive and an entrepreneur technologist, but also I think has shown his chops as a as a true diplomat. Do I do I need to bet, Gil, that listen, at the end of the day, ultimately, he's going to find a way through this?\n\n04:02 Gil Luria\n\nYes, to some extent, but it's not even necessary. Again, the magnitude of demand right now is such that Nvidia will continue to be able to grow even with a choppy Chinese market. I we're not going to know how many chips they can sell to China anytime soon. We thought they couldn't sell H100s, and now they can. And now they have to pay a tax on that. And then the Chinese government is encouraging domestic companies not to buy it. Then we're going to get into conversation about the B30 and what the specs are going to be around that, and will they be able to sell that, and are they going to be tracking chips, and are the Chinese going to consider that back door. That drama isn't going away anytime soon. And so investors have to just incorporate that into their analysis, realize that China is going to have its ups and downs. The rest of the business is on a good trajectory, and you can tune out the noise from uh from China. And then to your point, nobody's been able to maneuver this better than Jensen Huang so far. So you you can put some trust in that as well.

            "content": "Second quarter earnings season is winding down, and with most of the reports in, the results have been mostly positive.\n\nOver 92% of S&P 500 index companies have reported results, and as of Aug. 18, analysts expected S&P 500 companies to report an 11% jump in earnings per share during the second quarter.\n\nCompanies had lower expectations to clear coming into the quarter — analysts expected S&P 500 earnings to rise 5% in Q2, the slowest pace of earnings growth since Q4 2023 — amid President Trump's tariffs, stocks' lofty valuations, and uncertainty about the health of the US economy.\n\nNvidia (NVDA) results on Wednesday, Aug. 27, highlight this week's earnings\n\nOther companies reporting include PDD Holdings (PDD), Alibaba (BABA), Okta (OKTA), Abercrombie & Fitch (ANF), CrowdStrike (CRWD), Five Below (FIVE), HP (HP), Kohl's (KSS), Snowflake (SNOW), J.M.

The struggling chipmaker has been navigating Chapter 11 bankruptcy and is in the midst of a restructuring, after delays in CHIPS Act funding further hampered the company's finances.\n\nWolfspeed reported a loss per share $4.30, compared to a loss of $1.39 per share during the same period a year ago. Revenue came in at $197 million, compared to $201 million the previous year. Wall Street analysts expected worse results.\n\n“Reflecting upon my first three months with Wolfspeed, I am more confident than ever in my decision to join the Company and our opportunity to further strengthen our position in the industry,” Wolfspeed's new CEO, Robert Feurle, said in a statement. “Our next important milestone is for the court to approve our Plan of Reorganization next month, and emerge from Chapter 11 shortly thereafter, with a much stronger financial structure.” Today at 11:47 AM UTC\n\nGrace O'Donnell\n\nPDD stock jumps after the Temu owner beat earnings estimates\n\nPDD Holdings (PDD) stock gained 7% in premarket trading on Monday after the Chinese e-commerce giant beat earnings estimates by a wide margin.\n\nThe Temu and Pinduoduo owner reported earnings per American depository share (ADS) of 20.75 Chinese yuan (approximately $2.89) compared to estimates of 12.30 yuan ($1.72), per S&P Global Market Intelligence estimates.\n\nRevenue rose 7% year over year to 10.4 billion ($1.45 billion), barely beating estimates as price competition with rivals Alibaba (BABA) and JD.com (JD) and higher costs from tariffs weighed on margins.\n\n“Revenues growth further moderated this quarter amid intense competition,” said Jun Liu, PDD Holdings vice president of finance. \"As we remain focused on long-term value creation, the sustained investments may continue to weigh on short-term profitability.”\n\nRead more here from Reuters Fri, August 22, 2025 at 8:51 PM UTC\n\nGrace O'Donnell\n\nNvidia to highlight next week's earnings\n\nSecond quarter results from Abercrombie & Fitch (ANF), Kohl's (KSS), and Best Buy (BBY) next week will continue to beat the drum of retail earnings after reports from America's big box stores, Walmart (WMT) and Target (TGT).\n\nBut it's Nvidia's (NVDA) earnings that will be the star attraction, as the AI chipmaker's stock has an 8% weighting in the S&P 500 (^GSPC).\n\nAs Yahoo Finance Senior Tech Editor Dan Howley writes, investors will be squarely focused on Nvidia's data center business — even more so since the company announced a new gigascale networking plan that will combine the performance of multiple data centers to create one massive GPU. And many will be eager to hear more about a new China chip Nvidia is developing with the Trump administration.\n\nHere's a look at next week's earnings calendar, marking a sort of grand finale for the second quarter reporting season:\n\nMonday: PDD Holdings (PDD)\n\nTuesday: BMO (BMO), MongoDB (MDB), Okta (OKTA), PVH (PVH)\n\nWednesday: Nvidia (NVDA), Abercrombie & Fitch, CrowdStrike (CRWD), Five Below (FIVE), HP (HP), Kohl's, Pure Storage (PSTG), Snowflake (SNOW), The J.M.

That represents 66% annual earnings growth.\n\nThe company's founder and CEO, Eric Yuan, noted that the strong quarter comes as artificial intelligence reshapes the way people are working. The company highlighted its paid add-on for custom AI agents that help with meeting prep and call summaries as drivers.\n\nRevenue rose 5% to $1.2 billion, bolstered by 7% growth in Enterprise revenue. The company's monthly churn rate remained flat year over year at 2.9%.\n\nZoom also raised its full-year revenue outlook and free cash flow guidance, which is now expected to be in the range of $1.74 billion to $1.78 billion.\n\nFor the full 2026 fiscal year, total revenue is expected to be between $4.825 billion and $4.835 billion while diluted EPS is expected to be between $5.81 and $5.84.

Wall Street analysts were expecting earnings per share of $3.64 on revenue of $2.85 billion.\n\nAfter a sluggish spring season in the housing market, there have been signs of a resurgence, with housing starts jumping in July. But mortgage rates that have barely budged, ongoing economic uncertainty, and affordability challenges for buyers continue to weigh on the sector.\n\nFor the quarter, Toll Brothers noted it had 2,388 units under signed contract, a 4% decline from a year ago. Analysts had expected orders growth.\n\n\"The average sales price of new contracts was $1.0 million, up 4.5% year-over-year,\" CEO Douglas Yearley said in the earnings release. \"Contract dollars were flat despite a 4% decline in units. While affordability pressures and uncertain economic conditions persist, we are pleased with the resilience of our luxury business and more affluent customer base.\" Tue, August 19, 2025 at 8:32 PM UTC\n\nGrace O'Donnell\n\nLa-Z-Boy stock drops on soft earnings and guidance\n\nLa-Z-Boy stock (LZB) dropped 16% in after-hours trading after the company missed earnings estimates and navigated \"soft industry demand.\"\n\nOverall, comparable sales dropped 1% to $492 million from a year ago. Sales in the furniture retailer's wholesale segment increased 1%, and retail sales rose 5%, but they were offset by weakness in the Joybird brand, which saw sales decline 14%.\n\nLa-Z-Boy reported diluted earnings per share of $0.44, compared to $0.61 per share a year ago. The Street was looking for earnings of $0.52 per share.\n\nLa-Z-Boy's guidance also came in lighter than expected. It expects sales in the range of $510 million to $530 million in the fiscal second quarter. Wall Street was looking for $532 million, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence.

            "title": "Eric Trump Doubles Down On $1 Million Bitcoin Prediction: 'No Question In The World'",
            "content": "Benzinga and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue on some items through the links below.\n\nEric Trump has reportedly doubled down on a prediction that Bitcoin will eventually trade at $1 million.\n\nThe son of President Donald Trump and Trump Organization executive vice president said there is \"no question in the world\" that 1 BTC would eventually be worth $1 million at the SALT conference in Jackson Hole on Wednesday, CoinDesk reported.\n\nIn the short term, however, Eric said the asset will be worth at least $175,000 by the end of the year, according to CoinDesk.\n\nDon't Miss:\n\nThe same firms that backed Uber, Venmo and eBay are investing in this pre-IPO company disrupting a $1.8T market — and you can too at just $2.90/share. Kevin O'Leary Says Real Estate's Been a Smart Bet for 200 Years — This Platform Lets Anyone Tap Into It\n\nEric first predicted that Bitcoin would hit $1 million in December, hailing Bitcoin as a financial paradigm shift.\n\n\"I think that Bitcoin is a fundamental shift in the way we think about money,\" he said at the time, adding that the asset has impacted how he managed his company’s treasury and how he accepted and made payments.\n\nHe highlighted characteristics such as Bitcoin’s censorship resistance, supply cap and instant liquidity as reasons for his confidence in the asset. He also praised Bitcoin for its lack of intermediaries and low barrier to entry.\n\n\"I can trade Bitcoin at midnight on Saturday while having dinner with my wife,\" he said.\n\nTrending: 7 Million Gamers Already Trust Gameflip With Their Digital Assets — Now You Can Own a Stake in the Platform\n\nEric said that while most people did not recognize Bitcoin’s potential yet, \"eyes are going to be opened when Bitcoin hits $1 million.\"\n\nHe compared Bitcoin to technologies like email and SMS. He said that while the adoption of these technologies was initially slow, everyone now uses them.\n\nVested Interest\n\nThe Trump family has taken an increasingly personal interest in cryptocurrencies over the past year.\n\nIn October, they launched World Liberty Financial, a decentralized finance project that has launched its own stablecoin. Trump and first lady Melania Trumplaunched memecoins in January. Eric announced American Bitcoin in March, a Bitcoin mining firm that is partly owned by him and his brother, Donald Trump Jr. Meanwhile, Trump Media Technology Group (NASDAQ:DJT) announced the purchase of $2 billion worth of Bitcoin last month, even as it has filed to launch a \"Blue Chip crypto\" exchange-traded fund.\n\nStory Continues\n\nSee Also: If there was a new fund backed by Jeff Bezos offering a 7-9% target yield with monthly dividends would you invest in it?\n\nEric has repeatedly said the family was forced to pivot to cryptocurrencies after being shunned by the traditional finance industry due to political reasons.\n\n\"You know why Trump family got into crypto, right? They deplatformed us,\" Eric told Fox Business on Aug. 13. \"You’ve had a perfect relationship with them for the longest period of time, but they’re gone because we don’t like the fact that your father wears a red hat that says ‘Make America Great Again' on it. And honestly, it forced our whole family, it forced us as a company, to turn to an industry that we would have never been exposed to.\"\n\nBut for many onlookers, the Trump family’s cryptocurrency involvement poses a conflict of interest as the president champions pro-cryptocurrency legislation that directly benefits the family’s ventures.\n\nThese ventures have added $620 million to Trump’s net worth in recent months, Bloomberg reported in July.\n\nRead Next: 2,000 High Earners Manage $6B With This AI Platform — Learn More\n\nImage: Imagn Images\n\nThis article Eric Trump Doubles Down On $1 Million Bitcoin Prediction: 'No Question In The World' originally appeared on Benzinga.com\n\nView Comments",

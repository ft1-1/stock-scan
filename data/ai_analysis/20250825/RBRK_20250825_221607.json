On August 12, the company announced the launch of Agent Rewind, an industry-first agent rewind solution that enables organizations to undo mistakes made by agentic AI. Powered by Predibase AI infrastructure, Agent Rewind provides visibility into agents’ actions and enables enterprises to rewind those changes to applications and data.\n\nWhile AI agents boast significant potential, they are still prone to mistakes ranging from technical malfunctions and legal issues and even erasing of entire production databases. This is where the Agent Rewind comes into use by making opaque AI actions visible, auditable, and reversible.Rubrik (RBRK) Launches Agent Rewind to Undo AI Agent Mistakes\n\nThe solution creates an audit trail and immutable snapshots that allow safe rollback. Rubirk highlighted that current observability tools only show what happened, but not why or how to reverse high-risk actions.\n\nAgent Rewind is compatible with a wide range of platforms, APIs, and agent builders, including Agentforce, Microsoft Copilot Studio, and Amazon Bedrock Agents, and will be compatible with any custom AI agent.\n\n“As AI agents gain autonomy and optimize for outcomes, unintended errors can lead to business downtime. Agent Rewind integrates Predibase’s advanced AI infrastructure with Rubrik’s recovery capabilities to enable enterprises to embrace agentic AI confidently. Today’s organizations will now have a clear process to trace, audit, and safely rewind undesired AI actions.” -Anneka Gupta, Chief Product Officer at Rubrik.\n\nRubrik, Inc. (NYSE:RBRK) provides data security solutions to individuals and businesses worldwide.\n\nWhile we acknowledge the potential of RBRK as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.

Reference actual numbers in your reasoning.\n\n3. **Consistency**: Apply the same scoring standards regardless of the stock. A score of 85 should represent the same quality level across all analyses.\n\n4. **Risk Focus**: Pay special attention to red flags that could invalidate the opportunity (poor liquidity, imminent earnings, deteriorating fundamentals).\n\n5. **Strategy Alignment**: Consider how well this opportunity fits options strategies (directional bias, volatility conditions, time decay considerations).\n\n6. **Completeness Check**: If critical data is missing, note it in your analysis but don't penalize the opportunity excessively for data gaps.\n\nAnalyze the RBRK opportunity now using this framework and respond with the required JSON format.",

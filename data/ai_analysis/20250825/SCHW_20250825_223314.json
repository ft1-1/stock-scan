            "title": "SCHWAB (CHARLES) CORP (NYSE:SCHW) Presents Strong Technical and Setup Ratings for Potential Breakout",
            "content": "Technical analysis often relies on identifying stocks with strong underlying momentum that are simultaneously forming consolidation patterns, offering favorable risk-reward setups for potential breakouts. This approach combines two key metrics: the Technical Rating, which evaluates the overall health and trend strength of a stock, and the Setup Quality Rating, which assesses how well the stock is positioned for a potential entry. Stocks scoring highly in both categories are considered prime candidates for breakout strategies, as they represent technically sound instruments nearing potential upward moves.\n\n[SCHW Chart]\n\nSCHWAB (CHARLES) CORP (NYSE:SCHW [https://www.chartmill.com/stock/quote/SCHW/profile]) presents a notable case for technical investors based on these criteria. The company's strong technical foundation is evidenced by its outstanding Technical Rating of 9 out of 10, indicating solid long-term momentum and relative strength. According to the detailed technical analysis report [https://www.chartmill.com/stock/quote/SCHW/technical-analysis], SCHW demonstrates superior yearly performance compared to 86% of all stocks and outperforms 84% of its peers in the Capital Markets industry. The long-term trend remains positive despite recent neutral short-term movement, with the stock trading in the upper portion of its 52-week range while maintaining above all major moving averages.\n\nThe setup quality similarly impresses with a rating of 8, reflecting very good consolidation characteristics that technical traders seek. Over the past month, SCHW has been trading in a tight range between $94.35 and $99.59, with reduced volatility creating the type of base formation that often precedes significant moves. The analysis identifies a clear support zone between $95.28 and $95.51, providing a logical area for stop-loss placement, while resistance sits between $96.49 and $98.69. This compressed trading range, combined with recent pocket pivot activity indicating institutional accumulation, creates favorable conditions for a potential breakout above the resistance level.\n\nSeveral factors make this setup particularly attractive for technical investors. The combination of strong underlying technicals with a well-defined consolidation pattern offers both trend confirmation and clear risk management parameters. The stock's high liquidity, with average daily volume exceeding 8.6 million shares, ensures smooth entry and exit execution. The proximity to key moving averages provides additional confirmation of the stock's technical health, while the defined support and resistance levels create measurable risk-reward parameters.\n\nFor investors interested in exploring similar technical breakout opportunities, the Technical Breakout Setups screen [https://www.chartmill.com/stock/stock-screener?sid=202&f=v1_50b500,atrpct_a_1,sl_ta_7_X,sl_se_7_X,p_pg20&s=se&v=3&timeframe=WEEKLY&o1=3&op1=200,16711680&o2=3&op2=50,255&o3=1] regularly identifies stocks meeting these rigorous technical criteria, providing a valuable starting point for further analysis.\n\n_Disclaimer: This analysis is based on technical indicators and historical price patterns and should not be considered investment advice.

            "content": "Benzinga and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue on some items through the links below.\n\nWhen it comes to investing, Suze Orman has long been cautious about cryptocurrencies. For years, her advice was clear: only put money into Bitcoin that you could afford to lose. But on a recent episode of her \"Women & Money\" podcast, the personal finance expert shared that her perspective is shifting as digital assets become more mainstream.\n\nA Listener's Bitcoin Roadblock\n\nDuring the episode, a listener named Gina wrote in to say she had tried to buy a Bitcoin exchange-traded fund, or ETF — specifically, BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust (NASDAQ:IBIT) — through her Merrill Edge account. To her surprise, the platform restricted the purchase, citing the risks associated with Bitcoin investments.\n\nDon't Miss:\n\nThe same firms that backed Uber, Venmo and eBay are investing in this pre-IPO company disrupting a $1.8T market — and you can too at just $2.90/share. Kevin O'Leary Says Real Estate's Been a Smart Bet for 200 Years — This Platform Lets Anyone Tap Into It\n\nMerrill Lynch, which operates Merrill Edge, has held a cautious stance on cryptocurrency. Customer service told Gina that no Bitcoin-related purchases were allowed on the platform.\n\nGina wanted to know if there was a way around this restriction.\n\nSuze Orman's Advice: Look Beyond Merrill Edge\n\nOrman's response was straightforward. \"Obviously they won't allow you to do it,\" she said. If Gina really wanted to add Bitcoin to her portfolio, Orman suggested opening an account at firms like Charles Schwab (NYSE:SCHW) or Fidelity, which currently allow investors to purchase Bitcoin ETFs.\n\nThis advice reflects a broader trend. Many large brokerage firms have begun to embrace cryptocurrency products, particularly since the Securities and Exchange Commission approved spot Bitcoin ETFs last year.\n\nTrending: An EA Co-Founder Shapes This VC Backed Marketplace—Now You Can Invest in Gaming's Next Big Platform\n\nA Shift in Orman's Bitcoin Stance\n\nWhat stood out most from Orman's response was her update on how she views Bitcoin itself. She acknowledged that she used to advise investing only with money you could afford to lose. But now, she says she feels more comfortable with it.\n\n\"As it goes higher and higher in value, as major banks are starting to actually participate in it, I'm starting to feel better about it,\" Orman explained.\n\nWhile she still emphasized moderation, she said she had no problem with someone putting a small portion of their portfolio — perhaps around 5% — into a Bitcoin ETF like IBIT.\n\nStory Continues\n\nETF vs. Owning Bitcoin Directly\n\nOrman also noted a distinction between owning Bitcoin directly and buying an ETF. Investors who hold Bitcoin itself might see greater returns, she said, but ETFs can feel safer for those who prefer not to manage digital wallets or deal with the technical aspects of cryptocurrency.\n\nSee Also: Shaquille O'Neal wants people to take heart health seriously — this AI-ECG could make that easier.\n\nWhat This Means for Investors\n\nOrman's evolving stance highlights how the conversation around Bitcoin has changed. What was once seen primarily as a speculative gamble is now gaining legitimacy, especially with major financial institutions entering the space.\n\nStill, her advice remains cautious: if you're interested, consider keeping your Bitcoin exposure small and manageable within your overall portfolio.\n\nFor older investors — many of whom are focused on retirement planning — that balance between risk and opportunity is especially important.\n\nRead Next: If there was a new fund backed by Jeff Bezos offering a 7-9% target yield with monthly dividends would you invest in it?\n\nImage: Shutterstock\n\nThis article From 'Only What You Can Afford To Lose' To 'I Feel Better About It' — Suze Orman's New Bitcoin Advice originally appeared on Benzinga.com",

            "content": "LPL Financial LPLA witnessed a rise in total brokerage and advisory assets in July 2025. The metric was $1.94 trillion, which rose 1.1% from the prior month and 26.8% year over year.\n\nLPLA’s July Performance Breakdown\n\nOf LPLA’s total assets, brokerage assets were $862.4 billion whereas advisory assets amounted to $1.1 trillion. Brokerage assets increased 0.5% from June 2025 and surged 27.1% year over year. On the other hand, advisory assets rose 1.5% from the previous month and 26.6% from July 2024.\r\n\r\nTotal organic net new assets (NNAs) were $5.4 billion. It included $1.8 billion of off-boarded assets as part of the previously disclosed planned separation from misaligned large offices of supervisory jurisdiction. Excluding these assets, organic NNAs were $7.2 billion.\r\n\r\nLPL Financial reported $49.5 billion of total client cash balance in July, down 2.2% from the prior month but up 12.5% from July 2024. Of the total balance, $33.7 billion was insured cash, $10.8 billion was deposit cash, and the remaining was money-market sweep and client cash balance.\n\nOur Take on LPL Financial\n\nLPL Financial’s buyout of Commonwealth Financial Network, Investment Center and Atria Wealth, its solid advisor productivity and recruiting efforts will support advisory revenues. The company is expected to keep expanding inorganically, which will help diversify operations. However, uncertainty about the performance of the capital markets and substantial goodwill on the balance sheet are worrisome.\r\n\r\nIn the past year, LPLA shares have risen 61.4%, outperforming the industry’s growth of 39%.Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nCurrently, LPL Financial carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Reference actual numbers in your reasoning.\n\n3. **Consistency**: Apply the same scoring standards regardless of the stock. A score of 85 should represent the same quality level across all analyses.\n\n4. **Risk Focus**: Pay special attention to red flags that could invalidate the opportunity (poor liquidity, imminent earnings, deteriorating fundamentals).\n\n5. **Strategy Alignment**: Consider how well this opportunity fits options strategies (directional bias, volatility conditions, time decay considerations).\n\n6. **Completeness Check**: If critical data is missing, note it in your analysis but don't penalize the opportunity excessively for data gaps.\n\nAnalyze the SCHW opportunity now using this framework and respond with the required JSON format.",

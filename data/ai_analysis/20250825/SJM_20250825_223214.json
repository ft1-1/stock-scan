            "content": "Second quarter earnings season is winding down, and with most of the reports in, the results have been mostly positive.\n\nOver 92% of S&P 500 index companies have reported results, and as of Aug. 18, analysts expected S&P 500 companies to report an 11% jump in earnings per share during the second quarter.\n\nCompanies had lower expectations to clear coming into the quarter — analysts expected S&P 500 earnings to rise 5% in Q2, the slowest pace of earnings growth since Q4 2023 — amid President Trump's tariffs, stocks' lofty valuations, and uncertainty about the health of the US economy.\n\nNvidia (NVDA) results on Wednesday, Aug. 27, highlight this week's earnings\n\nOther companies reporting include PDD Holdings (PDD), Alibaba (BABA), Okta (OKTA), Abercrombie & Fitch (ANF), CrowdStrike (CRWD), Five Below (FIVE), HP (HP), Kohl's (KSS), Snowflake (SNOW), J.M. Smucker (SJM), Urban Outfitters (URBN), Affirm (AFRM), Best Buy (BBY), Bath & Body Works (BBWI), Dick's Sporting Goods (DKS), Dell (DELL), Dollar General (DG), Gap (GAP), Petco (WOOF), Wolfspeed (WOLF), and Ulta (ULTA).\n\nMeanwhile, markets will continue to digest last week's commentary on the health of consumer spending from Walmart (WMT), Target (TGT), Home Depot (HD), and Lowe's (LOW).\n\nHere are the latest updates from corporate America.LIVE274 updates\n\n12 mins ago\n\nGrace O'Donnell\n\nShares of struggling chipmaker Wolfspeed rise as results are better than feared\n\nWolfspeed (WOLF) stock rose just under 1% in after-hours trading following its fiscal fourth quarter results. The struggling chipmaker has been navigating Chapter 11 bankruptcy and is in the midst of a restructuring, after delays in CHIPS Act funding further hampered the company's finances.\n\nWolfspeed reported a loss per share $4.30, compared to a loss of $1.39 per share during the same period a year ago. Revenue came in at $197 million, compared to $201 million the previous year. Wall Street analysts expected worse results.\n\n“Reflecting upon my first three months with Wolfspeed, I am more confident than ever in my decision to join the Company and our opportunity to further strengthen our position in the industry,” Wolfspeed's new CEO, Robert Feurle, said in a statement. “Our next important milestone is for the court to approve our Plan of Reorganization next month, and emerge from Chapter 11 shortly thereafter, with a much stronger financial structure.” Today at 11:47 AM UTC\n\nGrace O'Donnell\n\nPDD stock jumps after the Temu owner beat earnings estimates\n\nPDD Holdings (PDD) stock gained 7% in premarket trading on Monday after the Chinese e-commerce giant beat earnings estimates by a wide margin.\n\nThe Temu and Pinduoduo owner reported earnings per American depository share (ADS) of 20.75 Chinese yuan (approximately $2.89) compared to estimates of 12.30 yuan ($1.72), per S&P Global Market Intelligence estimates.\n\nRevenue rose 7% year over year to 10.4 billion ($1.45 billion), barely beating estimates as price competition with rivals Alibaba (BABA) and JD.com (JD) and higher costs from tariffs weighed on margins.\n\n“Revenues growth further moderated this quarter amid intense competition,” said Jun Liu, PDD Holdings vice president of finance. \"As we remain focused on long-term value creation, the sustained investments may continue to weigh on short-term profitability.”\n\nRead more here from Reuters Fri, August 22, 2025 at 8:51 PM UTC\n\nGrace O'Donnell\n\nNvidia to highlight next week's earnings\n\nSecond quarter results from Abercrombie & Fitch (ANF), Kohl's (KSS), and Best Buy (BBY) next week will continue to beat the drum of retail earnings after reports from America's big box stores, Walmart (WMT) and Target (TGT).\n\nBut it's Nvidia's (NVDA) earnings that will be the star attraction, as the AI chipmaker's stock has an 8% weighting in the S&P 500 (^GSPC).\n\nAs Yahoo Finance Senior Tech Editor Dan Howley writes, investors will be squarely focused on Nvidia's data center business — even more so since the company announced a new gigascale networking plan that will combine the performance of multiple data centers to create one massive GPU. And many will be eager to hear more about a new China chip Nvidia is developing with the Trump administration.\n\nHere's a look at next week's earnings calendar, marking a sort of grand finale for the second quarter reporting season:\n\nMonday: PDD Holdings (PDD)\n\nTuesday: BMO (BMO), MongoDB (MDB), Okta (OKTA), PVH (PVH)\n\nWednesday: Nvidia (NVDA), Abercrombie & Fitch, CrowdStrike (CRWD), Five Below (FIVE), HP (HP), Kohl's, Pure Storage (PSTG), Snowflake (SNOW), The J.M. Smucker Company (SJM), Urban Outfitters (URBN), Williams-Sonoma (WSM)\n\nThursday: Affirm (AFRM), Best Buy (BBY), Bath & Body Works (BBWI), Dick's Sporting Goods (DKS), Dell (DELL), Dollar General (DG), Gap (GAP), Marvell (MRVL), Petco (WOOF), TD Bank (TD), Ulta (ULTA)\n\nFriday: Alibaba (BABA) Fri, August 22, 2025 at 12:15 PM UTC\n\nGrace O'Donnell\n\nRoss Stores tops quarterly profit estimates as shoppers seek discount apparel\n\nReuters reports:\n\nRead more here. Fri, August 22, 2025 at 12:07 PM UTC\n\nGrace O'Donnell\n\nBJ's Wholesale Club stock falls as fuel prices weigh on sales\n\nFuel prices weighed on BJ's Wholesale Club (BJ) sales in the second quarter, the company reported Friday.\n\nOverall comparable club sales decreased by 0.3% year over year, while comparable sales excluding gasoline increased by 2.3% annually.\n\nThe company reported earnings per share of $1.14, topping Wall Street's estimates for earnings of $1.09 per share. Revenue of $5.38 billion in the quarter disappointed expectations for $5.48 billion, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence\n\nBJ's reiterated its full-year revenue guidance and narrowed the range for its earnings outlook. For fiscal 2025, BJ's sees comparable club sales minus gasoline increasing 2% to 3.5% year-over-year. Adjusted EPS is expected to range from $4.20 to $4.35 instead of $4.10 to $4.30 previously forecast. Thu, August 21, 2025 at 8:42 PM UTC\n\nGrace O'Donnell\n\nZoom stock pops as CEO attributes earnings beat to AI\n\nZoom stock (ZM) popped 5% on Thursday afternoon after the company reported a huge earnings beat.\n\nZoom posted earnings per share of $1.16, compared to Wall Street analyst estimates for $0.72, per S&P Global Market Intelligence. That represents 66% annual earnings growth.\n\nThe company's founder and CEO, Eric Yuan, noted that the strong quarter comes as artificial intelligence reshapes the way people are working. The company highlighted its paid add-on for custom AI agents that help with meeting prep and call summaries as drivers.\n\nRevenue rose 5% to $1.2 billion, bolstered by 7% growth in Enterprise revenue. The company's monthly churn rate remained flat year over year at 2.9%.\n\nZoom also raised its full-year revenue outlook and free cash flow guidance, which is now expected to be in the range of $1.74 billion to $1.78 billion.\n\nFor the full 2026 fiscal year, total revenue is expected to be between $4.825 billion and $4.835 billion while diluted EPS is expected to be between $5.81 and $5.84. Thu, August 21, 2025 at 8:26 PM UTC\n\nGrace O'Donnell\n\nWorkday to acquire AI company Paradox, stock falls\n\nWorkday (WDAY) stock slipped more than 3% in after-hours trading following the company's announcement that it would acquire Paradox for an undisclosed amount. Paradox is an AI company that uses AI chatbots to simplify the job application process.\n\nWorkday also reported second quarter results that beat expectations. Subscription revenue increased 14%, lifting overall revenue to $2.35 billion in the second quarter. Wall Street was looking for revenue of $2.34 billion.\n\nDiluted earnings per share of $2.21 beat estimates of $2.12 per share.\n\n\"Our second quarter results reflect the strength of our platform and our continued progress across several of our growth initiatives,\" CFO Zane Rowe said. \"Following our first half momentum — and also incorporating the acquisition of Paradox — we are increasing our fiscal 2026 subscription revenue guidance to $8.815 billion, representing growth of 14%, and increasing our fiscal 2026 non-GAAP operating margin guidance to approximately 29%.\" Thu, August 21, 2025 at 8:15 PM UTC\n\nGrace O'Donnell\n\nIntuit forecasts first-quarter revenue growth below estimates\n\nShares of Intuit (INTU), the company behind tax-preparation and finance software TurboTax, Credit Karma, and QuickBooks, fell 5% after hours after the company forecast fiscal first quarter revenue growth below analyst estimates.\n\nReuters reports:\n\nIntuit's board also approved a new $3.2 billion share buyback plan, raising its total repurchase authorization to $5.3 billion.\n\nRead more here.

But the most recent results from the big box stores highlight how the two couldn't be more different.\n\nYahoo Finance's Brian Sozzi dived into the two retailers' quarters:\n\nRead more here. Thu, August 21, 2025 at 2:25 PM UTC\n\nGrace O'Donnell\n\nWalmart CEO: Tariff impact has been 'gradual,' but we expect costs to increase\n\nWalmart (WMT) reassured investors that it's continuing to gain market share and generate healthy sales growth.\n\nBut even though executives said the company didn't see any \"dramatic shifts\" with consumer behavior last quarter, they did communicate that keeping costs low could become a greater challenge in the second half of the year as tariff-related price increases work their way through inventory.\n\n\"With regards to our US pricing decisions, given tariff-related cost pressures, we're doing what we said we would do: We're keeping our prices as low as we can for as long as we can,\" Walmart CEO Doug McMillon said on Walmart's earnings call.\n\n\"The way things have played out so far, the impact of tariffs has been gradual enough that any behavioral adjustments by the customer have been somewhat muted,\" McMillon continued. \"But as we replenish inventory at post-tariff price levels, we've continued to see our costs increase each week, which we expect will continue into the third and fourth quarters.\"\n\nListen to a replay of the earnings call here.

Wall Street analysts were expecting earnings per share of $3.64 on revenue of $2.85 billion.\n\nAfter a sluggish spring season in the housing market, there have been signs of a resurgence, with housing starts jumping in July. But mortgage rates that have barely budged, ongoing economic uncertainty, and affordability challenges for buyers continue to weigh on the sector.\n\nFor the quarter, Toll Brothers noted it had 2,388 units under signed contract, a 4% decline from a year ago. Analysts had expected orders growth.\n\n\"The average sales price of new contracts was $1.0 million, up 4.5% year-over-year,\" CEO Douglas Yearley said in the earnings release. \"Contract dollars were flat despite a 4% decline in units.

Sales in the furniture retailer's wholesale segment increased 1%, and retail sales rose 5%, but they were offset by weakness in the Joybird brand, which saw sales decline 14%.\n\nLa-Z-Boy reported diluted earnings per share of $0.44, compared to $0.61 per share a year ago. The Street was looking for earnings of $0.52 per share.\n\nLa-Z-Boy's guidance also came in lighter than expected. It expects sales in the range of $510 million to $530 million in the fiscal second quarter. Wall Street was looking for $532 million, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence.

            "content": "NEW YORK, Aug.  25, 2025  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Pomerantz LLP is investigating claims on behalf of investors of  The J.M. Smucker Company (“Smucker” or the “Company”) (NYSE: SJM).  Such investors are advised to contact Danielle Peyton at newaction@pomlaw.com or 646-581-9980, ext. 7980.\n\nThe investigation concerns whether Smucker and certain of its officers and/or directors have engaged in securities fraud or other unlawful business practices.\n\n[Click here for information about joining the class action]\n\nOn November 7, 2023, Smucker announced the closing of a transaction to acquire Hostess Brands for about $5.5 billion, $2.4 billion of which was recorded as goodwill in SJM’s Sweet Baked Snacks segment. On February 27, 2025, Smucker announced disappointing Q3 2025 results, including in part a comparable net sales decrease of 8% in Sweet Baked Snacks, a $794 million impairment charge related to the goodwill of the Sweet Baked Snacks segment, a $208 impairment charge to the Hostess Brand trademark, and a $268 million loss on the disposal of the Voortman business. On June 10, 2025, Smucker reported disappointing Q4 2025 results, including in part a comparable net sales decrease of 14% in Sweet Baked Snacks, an additional $867 million impairment charge related to the goodwill of the Sweet Baked Snacks segment and an additional $113 million impairment of the Hostess Brand trademark. In contrast to prior assurances about synergies driving sustainable growth, the Company said its updated its 2026 financial plan reflects decreased net sales in the Sweet Baked Snacks segment, noting “the sustained underperformance of the sweet baked goods since acquisition, led to a reduction of the forecasted growth rate for the Sweet Baked Snacks reporting unit.”\n\nOn this news, Smucker’s stock price fell $17.44 per share, or 15.59%, to close at $94.41 per share on June 10, 2025.\n\nPomerantz LLP, with offices in New York, Chicago, Los Angeles, London, Paris, and Tel Aviv, is acknowledged as one of the premier firms in the areas of corporate, securities, and antitrust class litigation.

The deal will bolster Keurig Dr Pepper's (NASDAQ:KDP [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/KDP]) struggling coffee business and create a global coffee leader operating in over 100 countries with a vast portfolio spanning all major coffee segments. Following the close in the first half of 2026, Keurig Dr Pepper (KDP [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/KDP]) will split into two independent, publicly listed companies, with one focusing on coffee and the other on soft drinks and other beverages.\n\nThe new coffee company will be the second biggest global coffee company after Nestle (OTCPK:NSRGY [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NSRGY]), with $16 billion of pro forma long-term sales and $3.1 billion of EBITDA. Morgan Stanley analyst thinks the new coffee company will look to move past weakness in recent years to regain momentum. Notably, the portfolio will have four $1 billion brands, including Keurig, Jacobs, Peet's and L’OR, and six +$500 million brands, competing across all coffee formats and ranges of price points. Notably, the coffee company will be geographically balanced, with 40% of sales in North America, 40% in Europe, and 20% in the rest of the world.\n\nMeanwhile, the new beverage company is seen continuing to be a growth-focused, smaller challenger in the U.S. refreshment beverages business. The business will consist of KDP's (KDP [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/KDP]) current U.S. Refreshment Beverages and International segments (excluding the Canadian coffee business). Keurig's (KDP [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/KDP]) stable of beverages brands includes Dr Pepper, 7UP, Canada Dry, A&W Root Beer and Cream Soda, Crush, Sunkist, Squirt, Schweppes, RC Cola, Snapple, Bai, Mott's, and a controlling stake in Ghost.\n\nJefferies analyst Kaumil Gajrawala said a globally diversified operation makes sense. The firm thinks the beverage business standalone likely trades at a higher multiple. \"We don't anticipate anti-trust issues or a second buyer,\" advised Gajrawala.\n\nKepler Cheuvreux analyst Jon Cox said rolling the two coffee businesses together makes sense becuse it reduces the European-centric and commoditized nature of most of JDE Peet’s business, and gives Keurig international exposure.\n\nShares of JDE Peet's (OTCPK:JDEPF [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/JDEPF]) (OTCPK:JDEPY [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/JDEPY]) jumped more than 17% in Europe trading. Keurig Dr Pepper (KDP [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/KDP]) fell 8.2% in U.S. action. On a broad scale, the KDP-JDE Peet's combination could have implications for a wide range of companies, including Coca-Cola (KO [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/KO]), PepsiCo (PEP [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/PEP]), Monster Beverage (MNST [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MNST]), Nestle (OTCPK:NSRGY [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NSRGY]), TreeHouse Foods (THS [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/THS]), and J.M.

            "title": "Brown-Forman Q1 Earnings: Will Brand Strength Outweigh Margin Woes?",
            "content": "Brown-Forman Corporation (BF.B) is slated to release first-quarter fiscal 2026 results on Aug. 28. The alcoholic beverage bigwig’s revenues and earnings per share are expected to decline year over year in the fiscal first quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal first-quarter revenues is pegged at $911 million, indicating a rise of 4.2% from the year-ago quarter’s actual.\r\n\r\nThe consensus mark for earnings is pegged at 37 cents per share, indicating a decrease of 9.8% from the year-ago period’s reported number. Earnings estimates for the fiscal first quarter have been unchanged in the past 30 days.\r\n\r\nIn the last reported quarter, the company’s earnings missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 13.9%. In the trailing four quarters, BF.B delivered an earnings surprise of 1.1%, on average.\n\nWhat the Zacks Model Unveils\n\nOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Brown-Forman this time around. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat. But that is not the case here. You can uncover the best stocks before they are reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.\r\n\r\nBrown-Forman has an Earnings ESP of -3.62% and a Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell).\n\nKey Factors Likely to Affect BF.B’s Q1 Results\n\nBrown-Forman has been benefiting from its premiumization strategy and strong brand investments. Its premium and super-premium brands have supported its performance for some time. BF.B is advancing its pricing strategy, global expansion and revenue-growth management initiatives. The company has been gaining traction from portfolio evolution, Jack Daniel's Country cocktail business model change and strong price mix.\r\n\r\nBF.B has been taking actions to optimize its wood supply-chain strategy and improve operating costs. Gains in the international markets and the normalizing distributor inventory trends on a year-over-year basis will further aid. The impacts of such factors, coupled with gains across its premium and super-premium brands, diverse portfolio and extensive geographic reach, are likely to get reflected in the company’s top-line results in the fiscal first quarter.\r\n\r\nBrown-Forman plans to leverage disciplined cost management throughout fiscal 2026, targeting lower operating expenses even as it continues to invest behind its brands. Management expects a modest reduction in SG&A, driven by strategic workforce initiatives implemented in fiscal 2025, actions that should yield annualized savings of roughly $70-$80 million, while supporting key marketing and innovation programs. Gains from the decline in operating expenses are expected to have benefited the margins and the bottom line in the to-be-reported quarter.\n\nStory Continues\n\nBrown-Forman Corporation Price and EPS SurpriseBrown-Forman Corporation Price and EPS Surprise\n\nBrown-Forman Corporation price-eps-surprise | Brown-Forman Corporation Quote\n\nHowever, Brown-Forman anticipates a challenging operating environment throughout fiscal 2026, with limited visibility, driven by ongoing macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainty. A tepid macroeconomic landscape, including softened consumer demand and dampened discretionary spending across key markets, has been weighing on Brown-Forman’s quarterly performance.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, Brown-Forman’s margin performance has deteriorated meaningfully, reflecting both cost pressures and evolving portfolio dynamics. Looking ahead, the company expects margin headwinds to persist due to the ramp-down of high-margin used barrel sales, the transition to new U.S. distributors and the growing mix of lower-margin RTD offerings — risks that can weigh on profitability even if top-line growth returns.\r\n\r\nBrown-Forman is contending with consumer caution, the looming threat of new tariffs, and a downturn in non-branded used-barrel sales. The company expects consumer behavior and trade inventory levels to remain largely unchanged throughout fiscal 2026. The impacts of these trends are expected to be evident in the company’s margin and bottom-line results in the to-be-reported quarter.\n\nBF.B’s Stock Performance & Valuation Picture\n\nFrom a valuation perspective, Brown-Forman’s shares trade at a premium relative to the industry benchmarks. It has a forward 12-month price-to-earnings ratio of 18.61X, which is higher than the Beverages - Alcohol industry’s average of 15.24X.Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nThe recent market movements show that BF.B’s shares have lost 7.9% in the past three months compared with the industry's 5.5% decline.Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nStocks With the Favorable Combinations\n\nHere are a few more companies, which, according to our model, have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat:\r\n\r\nThe J.

            "content": "NEW YORK, Aug.  25, 2025  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Leading securities law firm Bleichmar Fonti & Auld LLP announces an investigation into The J.M.

Smucker manufactures and markets branded food and beverage products. In November 2023, the company completed an acquisition of Hostess Brands, Inc., a manufacturer and marketer of sweet baked goods brands. The company stated that the Hostess acquisition was “highly complementary” and that “underlying trends in snacking and specifically sweet snacking still bode well for the category.”\n\nIn truth, it appears the company’s Sweet Baked Snacks segment, which includes Hostess, significantly deteriorated in the face of declining trends in sweet snacking.\n\nThe Stock Declines as the Truth Is Revealed\n\nOn June 10, 2025, J.M. Smucker reported its Q4 2025 financial results and announced that it recognized a $867 million impairment charge related to the goodwill of its Sweet Baked Snacks segment and a $113 million impairment charge related to the Hostess brand trademark driven by the “continued underperformance of the Sweet Baked Snacks segment.” On this news, the price of J.M. Smucker stock fell $17.44 per share, or more than 18%, from $111.85 per share on June 9, 2025, to $94.41 per share on June 10, 2025.\n\nClick here for more information: https://www.bfalaw.com/cases/the-jm-smucker-company-class-action-lawsuit.\n\nWhat Can You Do?\n\nIf you invested in J.M.

A score of 85 should represent the same quality level across all analyses.\n\n4. **Risk Focus**: Pay special attention to red flags that could invalidate the opportunity (poor liquidity, imminent earnings, deteriorating fundamentals).\n\n5. **Strategy Alignment**: Consider how well this opportunity fits options strategies (directional bias, volatility conditions, time decay considerations).\n\n6. **Completeness Check**: If critical data is missing, note it in your analysis but don't penalize the opportunity excessively for data gaps.\n\nAnalyze the SJM opportunity now using this framework and respond with the required JSON format.",

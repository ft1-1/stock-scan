            "title": "Prediction: Chamath Palihapitiya's $250 Million SPAC Could Create the Next Palantir for America's Energy Grid",
            "content": "Key Points\n\nPalihapitiya's new SPAC focuses on four core themes: artificial intelligence (AI), energy production, crypto, and defense. While there are limitless candidates for the new SPAC, one software startup stands out as a compelling opportunity -- sharing some similarities with Palantir in its early days.  SPACs have been overly risky investments for quite some time, and Palihapitiya's personal track record is mixed.10 stocks we like better than Palantir Technologies ›\n\nRemember when special purpose acquisition companies (SPACs) dominated Wall Street headlines just a few years ago?\n\nAt the center of the frenzy was Chamath Palihapitiya -- better known on Wall Street as the \"SPAC king\". A former executive at AOL and Meta Platforms turned billionaire venture capitalist (VC), Palihapitiya made his name taking bold bets on disruptive companies.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now. Continue »\n\nFor a while, SPACs seemed to fade quietly into the background of stock market activity. But just as investors began to write them off, Palihapitiya reignited the conversation with a new prospectus for his latest $250 million \"blank check company\": American Exceptionalism Acquisition Corp. While details are limited at the moment, Palihapitiya has hinted at the kinds of businesses he's targeting.\n\nLet's break down what investors need to know about this SPAC, why Palihapitiya's recent move matters, and which company I think could be on his radar -- a potential candidate to become the next Palantir Technologies(NASDAQ: PLTR).\n\nWhat is American Exceptionalism Acquisition Corp.?\n\nIn the S-1 filing for American Exceptionalism Acquisition Corp., Palihapitiya outlines four core pillars he believes are essential to U.S. competitiveness -- artificial intelligence (AI), decentralized finance (DeFi), defense, and energy production.\n\nAt first glance, these may look like broad, boilerplate themes. But I see something deeper -- a unifying thesis that ties together some of the biggest secular growth opportunities underpinning the American economy.\n\nRight now, the American economy is experiencing something akin to the Industrial Revolution thanks to the booming impacts of AI. But with any megatrend comes significant trade offs.\n\nFor AI, the most pressing challenges are not software development or infrastructure manufacturing -- it's the strain on the U.S. power grid. Hyperscalers such as Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, Meta, Oracle, and OpenAI are pouring hundreds of billions of dollars into data centers, each requiring massive amounts of electricity to operate at scale.\n\nAnd it's not just the private sector. The U.S. government is moving aggressively with initiatives like Project Stargate, a $500 billion domestic infrastructure program designed to establish America's digital transformation.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, I think Palihapitiya may be eyeing a start-up sitting at the intersection of his four pillars.\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nWhat company could fit the bill for Chamath?\n\nIn my eyes, Houston-based Amperon could be a natural fit for the American Exceptionalism SPAC.\n\nAmperon functions as an operating system for the power grid, offering AI-powered software that delivers real-time intelligence to utilities, energy traders, and large power buyers. Its platform enables decision-makers to forecast demand, renewable output, and wholesale prices with greater precision -- addressing some of the most pressing challenges in the energy economy.\n\nIn many respects, Amperon can be thought of as the Palantir of climate tech. Just as Palantir's Artificial Intelligence Platform (AIP) synthesizes massive volumes of unstructured data and turns them into actionable insights for government agencies and large private enterprises, Amperon applies the same methodology to the grid. It translates fragmented inputs -- from weather patterns or anomalies in demand surges -- into a unified model for energy stakeholders.\n\nThe company has also built strategic collaborations with Microsoft, National Grid, and Acario (part of Tokyo Gas). Much like Palantir's early contracts, these partnerships have the potential to deepen and expand over time -- embedding Amperon's tools more firmly into data workflows.\n\nBoth Amperon and Palantir demonstrate how AI-driven software layers can evolve into indispensable infrastructure. Where Palantir dominates defense and enterprise intelligence, Amperon is carving out a parallel role capturing energy, climate, and grid optimization.\n\nAnd because energy touches every sector, Amperon's reach extends even further. Its intelligence platform could support crypto and DeFi protocols, where mining depends on reliable power sources, and strengthen defense applications, where resilient energy sources are critical to national security. This suggests that Amperon's total addressable market (TAM) is far broader than it might initially appear.\n\nUltimately, this vision aligns almost perfectly with the ethos of Palihapitiya's new SPAC: backing companies at the intersection of AI, defense, DeFi, and energy -- all rolled up and packaged into a compelling opportunity reshaping conscious capitalism.\n\nRemember to be careful with SPACs\n\nIn the disclosure section of the prospectus, Palihapitiya reminds investors that they should only consider this SPAC if they can \"embody the adage from President Trump that there can be 'no crying in the casino.'\" Harsh as it sounds, the warning is well placed.\n\nHistory hasn't been kind to SPACs. A University of Florida study found that SPACs across nearly every major industry have consistently underperformed the broader market over the past decade.\n\nSPCE data by YCharts\n\nPalihapitiya's own track record underscores this risk. Aside from MP Materials and SoFi Technologies, most of his SPACs have been financial catastrophes. As an investor, he has also backed other high-profile deals that flamed out -- including Desktop Metal and Berkshire Grey (both delisted) and Proterra and Sunlight Financial (both bankrupt).\n\nMy take is to approach the new SPAC with measured optimism, while keeping Palihapitiya's history of stewarding outside capital at the forefront of your thesis.\n\nAmerican Exceptionalism's converging focus on emerging themes across AI, defense, crypto, and energy might position it as a unique opportunity potentially poised for explosive growth. But smart investors understand that promise and hope are never true substitutes for prudent, disciplined investing.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Palantir Technologies right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Palantir Technologies, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Palantir Technologies wasn’t one of them.

Lululemon\n\nLululemon(NASDAQ: LULU) is a manufacturer and seller of sports apparel and footwear used for activities such as yoga, running, and other sweaty pursuits. The company reported both rising revenue and profits from fiscal 2022 to 2024, powered by its \"Power of Three x2\" strategic plan. An earlier \"Power of Three\" plan in 2019 allowed the apparel retailer to achieve its goals two years early, which led to the announcement of a second five-year plan to double its fiscal 2021 revenue of $6.5 billion by 2026. The table below shows Lululemon's track record in growing both its top and bottom lines.  Metric202220232024Revenue$6.257 billion$8.111 billion$9.619 billionOperating income$1.333 billion$1.328 billion$2.176 billionNet income$975.322 million$854.8 million$1.550 billion\n\nData source: Lululemon. Fiscal years end Jan. 31.\n\nThe yoga apparel maker not only saw its net income rise steadily over this period, it also churned out consistently higher free cash flow. Free cash flow went from $994.6 million to $1.6 billion from fiscal 2022 to fiscal 2024.\n\nLululemon's momentum has continued into the first three quarters of fiscal 2025. Revenue rose 8.8% year over year to $6.98 billion, while operating income climbed 20.1% year over year to $1.46 billion. Net income stood at $1.07 billion for the period, up 21.1% year over year. The company continued to churn out a positive free cash flow of $417.1 million.\n\nOverall, comparable store sales for the company increased by 4% for the third quarter of fiscal 2025. Although the American region saw a comparable store sales decline of 2%, the 25% surge for Lululemon's international division more than made up for it. During the quarter, Lululemon opened 28 new company-operated stores, taking its total global store count to 749.\n\nThe business recently raised its guidance for its fourth quarter, with net revenue expected to be in the range of $3.56 billion to $3.58 billion, representing a year-over-year growth of 11% to 12%. This range is above the previously guided range of $3.475 billion to $3.51 billion. Lululemon also upped its forecast for earnings per share to $5.81 to $5.85 for the quarter, up from the previous range of $5.56 to $5.64.\n\nManagement will continue to focus on the three key pillars of its \"Power of Three x2\" strategy -- product innovation, customer experience, and international market expansion -- to help the business post steady growth in both revenue and profits.\n\n2. FactSet\n\nFactSet(NYSE: FDS) operates a digital platform that delivers financial data and analytics to more than 8,200 global clients, including wealth managers, private equity firms, and buy-side and sell-side investment firms. Over the years, FactSet has steadily grown its business, as evidenced by the increases in revenue and net income as shown in the table below.  Metric202220232024Revenue$1.844 billion$2.086 billion$2.203 billionOperating income$475.482 million$629.207 million$701.299 millionNet income$396.917 million$468.173 million$537.126 million\n\nData source: FactSet. Fiscal years end Aug. 31.\n\nThe financial data provider also generates consistent positive free cash flow, and this free cash flow increased from $487.1 million in fiscal 2022 to $614.7 million by fiscal 2024. FactSet also saw its quarterly dividend rise without fail for more than two decades, with the latest quarterly dividend coming in at $1.04 per share, up 6.1% year over year. Shares of the company thus provide you with an attractive mix of growth and dividends.\n\nThe company continued to grow its top and bottom lines in the first quarter of fiscal 2025 ending Nov. 30, 2024. Revenue rose 4.9% year over year to $568.7 million, while operating income inched up 1.2% year over year to $191.3 million. Net income came in 1% higher than the prior year at $150 million, and the business once again generated a positive free cash flow of $60.5 million for the quarter. Annual subscription value (ASV), a measure of forward-looking revenue for the next 12 months for all of FactSet's subscription services, rose 4.9% year over year to $2.27 billion.\n\nThe business is growing on two fronts -- through bolt-on acquisitions that help to increase its platform capabilities, and through the innovative introduction of new features that should attract more customers. FactSet acquired Idacity, a company dealing with data structuring and collection technology, in July 2023. More recently, in October 2024, the company acquired Irwin, an investor relations and capital markets services provider for public companies. These tuck-in acquisitions help to boost FactSet's capabilities and better position the company to offer a comprehensive suite of services to existing and potential customers.\n\nLate last year, FactSet announced the integration of conversation artificial intelligence into its platform to enable customers to enjoy higher productivity while enhancing their decision-making capabilities through more efficient workflows.\n\nDuring last year's Investor Day, management identified a massive total addressable market of more than $40 billion, which continues to grow as the company adds more products and services to its portfolio. Based on this number, there is still significant room for FactSet to increase its profits and dividends in the years to come.\n\n3. Full Truck Alliance\n\nFull Truck Alliance(NYSE: YMM) operates a digital platform that connects shippers with truckers and offers a range of services such as freight matching, freight brokerage, and online transaction services. The company is adept at using technology to revolutionize the supply chain and enhance logistics networks. Growth has been rapid as shown in the table below, with revenue surging ahead from RMB 4.7 billion in 2021 to RMB 8.4 billion by 2023. The business went from a net loss in 2021 to generating an impressive net income of RMB 2.2 billion in 2023.  Metric202120222023RevenueRMB 4.657 billionRMB 6.734 billionRMB 8.436 billionOperating income(RMB 3.796 billion)(RMB 162.002 million)RMB 997.429 millionNet income(RMB 4.173 billion)RMB 406.762 millionRMB 2.212 billion\n\nData source: Full Truck Alliance. Fiscal years end Dec. 31. Note: RMB = Renminbi; 1 RMB is worth about $0.14 at current exchange rates.\n\nOn the cash flow front, Full Truck Alliance has also done well. Operating cash flow stayed negative for both 2021 and 2022 but turned positive in 2023 at RMB 2.27 billion, and the business generated its first free cash flow of $2.17 billion in three years.\n\nFull Truck Alliance continued to report strong financial numbers for the first nine months of 2024. Revenue climbed 33.8% year over year to RMB 8.06 billion, while operating income more than doubled year over year to RMB 1.64 billion. Net income stood at $2.5 billion, surging by 54% year over year.\n\nOperating statistics were also encouraging, with the average shipper monthly average users (MAUs) jumping 33.6% year over year to 2.84 million and fulfilled orders rising 22.1% year over year to 51.9 million. The increase in volume attests to the attractiveness of Full Truck Alliance's platform and its ability to consistently match shippers to truckers to enable the smooth flow of goods.\n\nThe company enjoys powerful network effects that make customers sticky and attract new customers. As it becomes easier for shippers to find truckers, truckers will enjoy better utilization and earn more. Shippers can thus handle more orders and get better matched to truckers, while truckers suffer fewer empty miles, creating a win-win scenario for both parties.\n\nDuring 2023's Investor Day session, management identified a massive total addressable market -- China's road transportation market is worth around RMB 7 trillion. Of this amount, close to RMB 5.5 trillion is for \"full-truckload\" (FTL) and \"less-than-truckload\" (LTL) logistics, with the remainder being express deliveries.\n\nOf the RMB 5.5 trillion, around RMB 3 trillion represents non-contracted spot demand with huge potential to be tapped for online penetration. The size of this market should enable Full Truck Alliance to post continued growth for many years as it eases the pain points for both shippers and truckers.\n\nDon’t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

            "title": "Trending stocks as Fed Chair speech buoys struggling market",
            "content": " [Financial advisor interacts with a digital interface displaying machine learning data insights.] \nGetty Images\n\nA dovish speech by Fed Chair Jerome Powell at the Jackson Hole conference triggered a strong Friday rally across markets and helped Wall Street avoid a loss over the week.\n\nBefore Powell’s speech reignited hopes for a rate cut in September, the U.S. stock market was hurt by a rout in technology stocks and disappointing retail earnings.\n\nNevertheless, the S&P gained 0.3% over the course of the five-day trading week, just shy of its all-time high. The blue-chip Dow also rose 1.6% for the week, closing at a record high near 45,632.\n\nThe tech-focused Nasdaq Composite still ended in a decline, as cautious investors ahead of Jackson Hole sold off megacap tech names.\n\nAmid the week's earnings, rallies. and selloffs, these were some of the trending stocks:\n\nNovo Nordisk (NVO [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NVO]) was in spotlight after it secured FDA’s accelerated approval for Wegovy to treat metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis , a serious liver condition. The Danish drugmaker also entered into a collaboration with GoodRx (GDRX [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GDRX]) to supply type 2 diabetes and weight loss meds Ozempic and Wegovy for $499 a month for self-pay customers. GoodRx shares surged on the announcement.\n\nPalantir Technologies (PLTR [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/PLTR]) extended its decline, falling over 13% in the week. The AI software firm fell in six straight sessions since Aug 13, marking its longest losing streak since April 2024 that pushed the company further into correction territory.\n\nPalo Alto Networks (PANW [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/PANW]) was in the spotlight after its latest quarterly results and guidance were better-than-expected and the company received substantial praise from Wall Street analysts. Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives said the results and guidance are indicative that the platformization strategy led by CEO Nikesh Arora is resonating with its customers.\n\nSoFi (SOFI [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SOFI]) said it will launch an international money transfer service later this year, allowing members to send funds abroad directly through the SoFi app with lower fees and faster delivery than traditional providers. The service, powered by Lightspark’s Universal Money Address and the Bitcoin Lightning Network, will make SoFi one of the first U.S. banks to offer blockchain-based remittances.\n\nIntel (INTC [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/INTC]) shares popped after announcing a definitive securities purchase agreement in which SoftBank will make a $2B investment in its common stock, paying $23/share. The deal will make SoftBank the sixth largest investor in Intel, an equity stake of slightly less than 2%, according to LSEG data.\n\nDayforce (DAY [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/DAY]) has entered into a definitive agreement with Thoma Bravo to become a privately held company in an all-cash transaction with an enterprise value of $12.3 billion. The per-share purchase price represents a premium of 32% over the company’s unaffected closing share price on August 15.\n\nWalmart (WMT [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/WMT]) shares fell after second-quarter adjusted EPS and gross margin missed estimates, pressured by higher liability claims and SG&A. It marked the retailer’s first adjusted EPS miss since May 2022, Bloomberg data showed. On a conference call with analysts, CEO Doug McMillon said that as the company replenishes inventory at “post-tariff price levels,” it has continued to see costs increase each week, which is expected to continue into the remaining quarters.\n\nHertz (HTZ [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/HTZ]) shares rose after it announced a pact with Amazon Autos (AMZN [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AMZN]), allowing shoppers to browse, finance, and purchase from a selection of pre-owned vehicles through Amazon Autos.\n\nTarget (TGT [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/TGT]) shares plunged after the retailer’s decision to appoint an internal candidate as CEO overshadowed stronger-than-expected Q2 results and reaffirmed guidance. The retailer tapped Michael Fiddelke, chief operating officer, to succeed Brian Cornell as chief executive officer and become a member of its board of directors. This isn’t a “knock” on Fiddelke, but the announcement “lacks the pop that a significant external hire would provide,” DA Davidson’s Michael Baker writes.\n\nZIM Integrated Shipping (ZIM [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ZIM]) fell after reporting sharply lower Q2 earnings due to lower freight rates and volumes. Q2 net income plunged to $24M from $373M in the year-earlier quarter, while revenues fell 15% Y/Y to $1.64B, as the company carried 895K teu in the quarter compared to 952K teu and the average freight rate fell to $1,479/teu from $1,674/teu in the year-ago quarter.\n\nJames Hardie (JHX [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/JHX]) sank on Wednesday after reporting a 29% decline in first-quarter profit due to high borrowing costs, triggering its biggest one-day share decline.\n\nMORE ON THE TRENDING STOCKS\n\n \t* ZIM Integrated Shipping: $20 Offer Too Low, FY2025 Guidance Appears Bleak (Rating Downgrade) [https://seekingalpha.com/article/4816229-zim-integrated-shipping-20-offer-too-low-fy2025-guidance-appears-bleak]\n \t* Intel's Big Break: Trump, SoftBank, And Fed Rate Cuts Could Spark A Comeback [https://seekingalpha.com/article/4816145-intel-big-break-trump-softbank-and-fed-rate-cuts-could-spark-comeback]\n \t* Intel Value Deteriorates As Competition Intensifies And Foundry Capex Continues [https://seekingalpha.com/article/4816105-intel-value-deteriorates-as-competition-intensifies-and-foundry-capex-continues]\n \t* U.S. investment in Intel a 'terrible decision bad for almost everyone' - Cato Institute [https://seekingalpha.com/news/4488563-u-s-investment-in-intel-a-terrible-decision-bad-for-almost-everyone-cato-institute]\n \t* Bulls vs. Bears: Is Palantir ahead of a long-term downtrend?

On August 13, an analyst at TD Cowen raised their price target of the stock to $72 from $62 while reiterating a ‘Buy’ rating.Cathie Wood Stock Portfolio: Top 10 Stocks to Buy Now\n\nLikoper/Shutterstock.com\n\nThe price target hike comes on the research firm being impressed by the company’s substantial genomic volumes and positive outlook in the Ambry business. Tempus AI continues to deliver improved performance in its genomic segment, prompting analysts to increase volume growth projections. TD Cowen also expects Tempus AI to continue gaining market share and growth in its Ambry business.\n\nThe growth forecast comes as Tempus AI delivered $314.6 million in revenue in the second quarter, significantly above the anticipated revenue of $297.8 million. The company also reported a narrow loss of $0.22 per share, compared to an expected loss of $0.25 per share.\n\nTempus AI, Inc.

            "title": "Can AI make clinical trials better?",
            "content": "Investing.com -- Clinical trials are notorious for being expensive and slow, with rising costs and declining efficiency. According to Bernstein, industry R&D spending grew 44% between 2012 and 2022, while the number of novel drug approvals in the U.S. stayed flat.\n\n“As of 2024, it was estimated that up to 80% of clinical trials overshoot their forecasted timelines,” the broker said in a recent report.\n\nThe challenges are long-standing. An NIH study of 640 phase 3 trials found that 54% failed, with 57% of those due to insufficient efficacy and 17% from safety issues. Financial and logistical barriers also weigh heavily: 22% of failed trials lacked adequate funding, while recruitment shortfalls and restrictive eligibility criteria often undermine results.\n\nA McKinsey study cited by Bernstein estimated per-patient costs above $40,000, with the average span from Phase I to launch stretching roughly a decade. Success rates hover at just 10–12%.\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI) is now being tested as a potential solution. In theory, AI could support every stage of the process, from design to analysis.\n\nIn trial design, for example, AI can draw on real-world data such as past studies, electronic health records, and patient registries to refine eligibility criteria and propose more measurable endpoints.\n\nThis, Bernstein analysts said, “allows for faster, more efficient trials with higher chances of success.”\n\nRecruitment is another area where AI could play a major role. By analyzing electronic health records, lab results, and clinical notes, AI systems can match patients more precisely to trials.\n\nNatural language processing can help uncover eligible candidates from unstructured medical data, while machine learning models forecast enrollment timelines and highlight effective recruitment channels.\n\nAnalysts said that “early detection of lagging enrollment allows sponsors to implement corrective actions before delays escalate.”\n\nOnce a trial is underway, AI can assist in monitoring by tracking site performance in real time. Advanced models can detect anomalies in protocol compliance, adverse event reporting, or data entry, enabling sponsors to address problems before they slow down a study.\n\nSimilarly, in the analysis phase, AI tools can detect subtle treatment effects, generate synthetic control arms from historical data, and accelerate statistical modeling.\n\nA growing number of companies are already pursuing this opportunity.\n\nBernstein grouped them into three categories: traditional contract research organizations like IQVIA Holdings (NYSE:IQV), Icon (NASDAQ:ICLR), and  Fortrea Holdings  (NASDAQ:FTRE); health-tech firms such as Medidata, ConcertAI, Massive Bio, and Flatiron Health; and hybrid players like  Tempus AI  Inc (NASDAQ:TEM) and  Caris Life Sciences  Inc (NASDAQ:CAI), which combine diagnostics, sequencing, and AI-enabled trial matching.\n\nSeveral have forged partnerships with technology leaders—IQVIA and ConcertAI both collaborate with NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) to develop AI agents for trial workflows.\n\nThe foundation of these efforts is data, and companies emphasize the scale of their collections. Caris describes its repository as “one of the largest, multi-modal databases of combined molecular and clinical outcomes data in the world,” while Medidata cites information from more than 36,000 trials and 11 million patients.\n\nStill, Bernstein cautioned that despite heavy investment and rapid innovation, the role of AI in clinical trials remains uncertain.\n\n“In five years, when the dust settles, the influence of AI may feel less like a revolution and more like plumbing: foundational, invisible, and absolutely essential.\n\nConversely, AI may struggle to make significant inroads into a highly-regulated and inefficient industry,” the analysts wrote.\n\nWhat is clear, the report concludes, is that with costs escalating and trial timelines stretching, the industry is in urgent need of change—whether driven by AI or other forms of innovation.",

            "title": "The Next Big Thing: 2 AI-Powered Healthcare Stocks Ready to Explode",
            "content": "Key Points\n\nThe healthcare industry generally takes a more cautious approach to the use of artificial intelligence, but it is happening. AI is being used to sift through massive amounts of digital data to provide actionable, straightforward answers. Artificial intelligence is proving particularly effective as a means of optimizing drug testing, but also patient usage of drugs. 10 stocks we like better than Recursion Pharmaceuticals ›\n\nIt's certainly no secret that artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to change, well, everything for most industries. It's already reshaped several sectors, in fact, and promises to reshape even more in the foreseeable future. That's why so many AI stocks have performed so well for a while now.\n\nStill, there are some industries that seem to remain mostly untouched by artificial intelligence. Take healthcare as an example. Perhaps the industry's corporate guardians are a bit hesitant to turn over something as important as someone's life to technology that still isn't outright guaranteed to do the right thing.\n\nNow dig deeper. While certainly not as high-profile as OpenAI's ChatGPT or Nvidia's autonomous vehicle tech currently being test-driven by carmakers like Toyota Motor and Rivian Automotive, several healthcare companies are indeed commercializing AI. It's just still early days for this aspect of the business; users are taking things slowly.\n\nThis fairly slow pace of adoption isn't a bad thing, though. It means interested investors can still get in near the ground floor.\n\nHere are two promising AI-powered healthcare stocks to consider stepping into before they take off.Image source: Getty Images.\n\nRecursion Pharmaceuticals\n\nDeveloping a new drug isn't cheap. Estimates range from hundreds of millions of dollars to over $1 billion apiece, with most of the ones that begin clinical trials never even getting close to an actual approval; most failures are seen in phase 2 (of 3) clinical testing. It's such an expensive waste that some fantastic prospective drugs may forever remain undeveloped, or even tested in pre-clinical trials.\n\nWhat if, however, there were a way to pre-test the potential of a new drug without actually risking any real time or significant funding in doing so? There is. Recursion Pharmaceuticals(NASDAQ: RXRX) built it.\n\nIt's called Recursion OS. Using 36 petabytes (36 million gigabytes) of biological and chemical data, Recursion OS can virtually test how a particular drug idea might perform in a real-world setting at a fraction of the cost of an actual clinical trial.\n\nLire la suite\n\nIt's not a replacement for a clinical trial, to be clear. The FDA and other nations' regulatory agencies will still require actual patient testing for any drug. But when the odds of success or failure can be determined in a matter of hours for a pittance rather than found out the hard way -- over the course of years at a cost of hundreds of millions of dollars -- Recursion Pharmaceuticals' platform helps pharmaceutical companies know where to focus, and what to not bother developing.\n\nIts business model is twofold. Recursion is working on some drugs of its own, including a handful of cancer therapies in early-stage testing. It's also working with established outfits like Roche and Sanofi, granting them paid access to Recursion OS in hopes of the co-development of a new drug.\n\nThere's no real revenue to speak of yet. The company's top line through the first six months of this year is just under $34 million, versus a net loss of $374 million. These sorts of results, of course, fuel plenty of volatility for the stock, which is further fueled by an unclear and ever-changing future. Just bear in mind there's nothing unusual about sizable or persistent losses for young drug developers.\n\nAnd for what it's worth, the analyst community thinks Recursion Pharmaceuticals' bright future isn't too far down the road. It expects revenue to triple between now and 2027, halving its losses in the process en route to profitability.\n\nTempus AI\n\nThe other AI-powered healthcare company worth a closer look is Tempus AI(NASDAQ: TEM).\n\nIts tech isn't nearly as eye-popping as Recursion's; Tempus' solutions are far more practical and accessible to caregivers. But this makes them immediately more marketable ... and profitable. The $13 billion company did $693 million worth of business last year, up 30% year over year. While still operationally in the red, most of last year's losses stem from stock-based compensation and employment taxes. If it continues to grow as expected, Tempus AI could outgrow these losses and move into the black as soon as fiscal 2027.\n\nBut what is it? It's a little of everything, but it's best described as all-encompassing software that helps caregivers take better care of patients. For instance, it can help diagnose diseases that aren't readily evident, suggest clinical trials that may be of value to a patient who's running out of options, or even predict the efficacy of a particular course of treatment. It's possible to use its platform, however, without even realizing you're utilizing AI.\n\nIt's not just for doctors and caregivers, though. Patients also have a portal, as do pharmaceutical companies like the aforementioned Roche and Sanofi.\n\nAll of these platforms are designed with the same goal in mind, however. That's improving patient outcomes by streamlining the delivery of a lot of often overwhelming information. This is actually a pretty savvy and common-sense use of artificial intelligence.\n\nTempus AI is also a stock that interested investors may not want to put on the back burner for too long, waiting to see what happens next.\n\nAlthough the company's still unprofitable, that's changing quickly. More and more investors know it, too. While this hasn't helped shares make any major net progress since last June's initial public offering (IPO), it certainly seems like the bulls are increasingly testing the waters as the narrative takes on a more bullish tone. The company recently raised its full-year guidance, for example, due to new product launches. Analysts are also gradually raising their price targets, with some of them seemingly waiting for the stock to begin a more consistent bullish performance before making bolder calls.

            "content": "Delray Beach, FL, Aug.  24, 2025  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- In terms of value, the Automotive Refinish Coatings Market is estimated to grow from USD 11.12 billion in 2024 to USD 13.85 billion by 2030, at a CAGR of 3.68%, as per the recent study by MarketsandMarkets™. The used car ecosystem is increasingly becoming more organized and quality-conscious as the certified pre-owned (CPO) programs and digital car-selling platforms continue to spread. Users of secondhand cars are demanding an almost new look and vehicles; thus, sellers must recondition them cosmetically prior to selling them in the market. The application of refinish coatings can play a primary role in bringing such transformation, and it can be used to remove all the visual imperfections, correct original paint finishes, and protect the surface of the exterior against additional deterioration. The increasing sophistication of the used car dealership has demanded the need for high-performance coatings that can be rapidly applied and have an enduring outcome.\n\nDownload PDF Brochure: https://www.marketsandmarkets.com/pdfdownloadNew.asp?id=9257396\n\nBrowse in-depth TOC on “Automotive Refinish Coatings Market”\n\n123 - Market Data Tables\r\n48 – Figures\r\n190 - Pages\n\nList of Key Players in Automotive Refinish Coatings Market:\n\n3M      Company (US)Tesa      SE (Germany)Nitto      Denko Corporation (Japan)LINTEC      Corporation (Japan)Intertape      Polymer Group, Inc. (Canada)Avery      Dennison Corporation (US)Lohmann      GmbH & Co. KG (Germany)Berry      Global Group, Inc. (US)Scapa      Group plc (Mativ Holdings) (US)Saint-Gobain      S.A. (France)\n\nDrivers, Opportunities and Challenges in Automotive Refinish Coatings Market:\n\nDrivers: Expanding      automotive aftermarket servicesRestraint: Shift      toward paintless repair techniques Opportunity: Adoption of eco-friendly coatingsChallenge: Stringent      Environmental Regulations\n\nGet Sample Pages: https://www.marketsandmarkets.com/requestsampleNew.asp?id=9257396\n\nKey Findings of the Study:\n\nThe      basecoat segment is projected to be the second-fastest-growing segment in      the automotive refinish coatings market during the forecast periodThe      acrylic segment accounted for the second-largest share in the automotive      refinish coatings market in 2024The      commercial vehicles segment held the second-largest share in the      automotive refinish coatings market in 2024.North      America was the second-largest region in the global automotive refinish      coatings market in terms of value in 2024.\n\nBased on layer type, the automotive refinish coatings market is divided into primer, basecoat, clearcoat, and other layer types. Clearcoat held the largest share in the automotive refinish coatings market in 2024. The dominance of this can be attributed to the fact that clearcoats are an essential component of imparting aesthetic brilliance and long-term durability of surfaces that have been repaired. Clearcoats are a final layer of protection over the basecoat and the primer, as they protect the basecoat and the primer against environmental decline, chemicals, and ultraviolet radiation. With modernly fitted luxurious cars having elaborate design features and bright colors, it has become necessary to repair them without the paint being affected after being touched. Thus, clearcoats improve the amount of gloss retention and color brightness and allow the refinished surface to match the factory finish, fueling the growth of the segment in the market.\n\nBased on resin type, the automotive refinish coatings market is segmented into polyurethane acrylic, epoxy, alkyd, and other resin types. The polyurethane segment held the largest share in the automotive refinish coatings market in 2024. The greater portion is due to the rising popularity of a durable finish that maintains its beauty over the years. Polyurethane resin provides better abrasion resistance, chemical resistance, and UV resistance in a market where there is a growing requirement to have technical capabilities besides the visual aspects of contending against tough environmental conditions. Polyurethane coatings retain their structural and aesthetic appeal over a long time, regardless of intense sunshine or changing weather patterns, which lack in other resin types. In addition to private auto owners, automotive repair businesses, and companies managing vehicle fleets highly value polyurethane resins due to their longevity and ability to maintain resale value.\n\nGet Customization on this Report: https://www.marketsandmarkets.com/requestCustomizationNew.asp?id=9257396\n\nBased on vehicle type, the automotive refinish coatings market is divided into passenger cars and commercial vehicles. The passenger cars segment dominated the automotive refinish coatings market in 2024. The rapid development and integration of modern digital color matching technologies throughout automotive service centers, especially in the ecosystem for passenger car maintenance, is the reason for this dominance. Digital color-matching technologies have made it possible for automotive repair facilities to improve the accuracy and uniformity of refinish coatings, as customers seek flawless restorations that mimic factory finishes. Such technologies have given technicians the ability to perfectly duplicate complex OEM color palettes and effects, such as metallic or pearls, with a precision that could not be found before. This technological sophistication is essential in the case of passenger cars, in which the compelling presentation implies the critical value of the resale price and brand image.\n\nBased on the region, Asia Pacific was the largest market of automotive refinish coatings, in terms of value, in 2024. The growth can be attributed to the steady rise in the middle-class population in developing economies like India, Indonesia, and the Philippines. The affordable finance and growing disposable income have also seen a large fraction of this population buying personal vehicles, and in most cases, the used or second-hand ones. With the growth in the number of vehicles that are owned and used, the need to perform refinishing jobs to improve or re-establish the aesthetics as well as the functional values of vehicles grows. Refinish coatings play an important role in enhancing the look of the surface and weather resistance, as well as prolonging the years of usage of the vehicle. Such ownership trend also stimulates the need for affordable repair services, and automotive refinish coatings are at the center of it. In these countries, the local body shops and independent garages, which comprise a predominant share of vehicle service providers, need cost-efficiency and yet enhanced refinish products, driving the demand.\n\nBrowse Adjacent Markets Coatings Adhesives Sealants and Elastomers Market Research Reports & Consulting\n\nRelated Reports:\n\nSeptic      Tanks MarketDenim      Finishing Agents MarketTexture      Paint MarketHydrogen      Storage MarketFlow      Chemistry Market",

            "title": "Prediction: All \"Ten Titans\" Stocks Will Surpass $1 Trillion in Market Cap by 2030",
            "content": "Key Points\n\nThe Ten Titans expand on the “Magnificent Seven” by adding three high-octane growth stocks. Buying Oracle near an all-time high is a bet that its aggressive AI spending will pay off. Netflix should be able to deliver high-margin growth as it shifts its business model from increasing subscribers to boosting free cash flow. 10 stocks we like better than Oracle ›\n\nIn early August 2018, Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) became the first U.S. company to surpass $1 trillion in market cap.\n\nFast forward seven years, and there are nine S&P 500(SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) components with market caps over $1 trillion:  the \"Magnificent Seven\" consisting of Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT), Apple, Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN), Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL), Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META), and Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA), plus Broadcom(NASDAQ: AVGO) and Berkshire Hathaway(NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B).\n\nThe \"Ten Titans\" include the ten largest growth-focused companies by market cap -- the Magnificent Seven and Broadcom, Oracle(NYSE: ORCL), and Netflix(NASDAQ: NFLX).\n\nHere's how Oracle and Netflix can join the rest of the Ten Titans in the $1 trillion club by 2030.Image source: Getty Images.\n\nOracle is a high-risk, high-potential-reward AI play\n\nOracle's market cap at the time of this writing is $660.2 billion. Oracle has gone from a dividend-paying tech stalwart to a business unlocking transformational growth in just a matter of years. And investors have responded, as Oracle is up a staggering 70% in the last year and 318% in the last five years.\n\nOracle's cloud business is growing faster than incumbents Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud, as Oracle has done a masterful job leveraging cloud with its established data center model, implementing a competitive pricing model, and forming partnerships with the major cloud providers.\n\nOracle is pricey, at 34.6 times forward earnings estimates, making it more expensive than the larger, more established cloud players. However, Oracle has a number of advantages that could pole vault its market cap well above $1 trillion by 2030.TSLA PE Ratio (Forward) data by YCharts.\n\nFor starters, Oracle is a pure play enterprise software and solutions company. Unlike Amazon, Microsoft, and Alphabet -- which are basically tech conglomerates -- Oracle doesn't have a consumer-facing business. This gives Oracle a much more focused investment thesis and allows the company to zero in its capital expenditures (capex) on building out its cloud infrastructure and application network.\n\nOracle has been one of the most aggressive companies when it comes to deploying capex into artificial intelligence (AI). As you can see in the following chart, Oracle went from a company that was chugging along and maintaining its legacy business to pouring money into capex even though its operating income hasn't grown nearly as quickly.\n\nStory Continues\n\nORCL Capital Expenditures (TTM) data by YCharts.\n\nIf Oracle's investments translate to earnings growth, the stock could defend its premium valuation and have an easy path to a $1 trillion market cap and beyond.\n\nHowever, it's worth mentioning that Oracle's balance sheet is highly leveraged with debt, and its free cash flow is negative as it front-loads AI investments.\n\nBuying Oracle is a bet that its ultra-aggressive capex spending is worth it. If it disappoints, Oracle stock could correct and remain beaten down for some time, which could throw a wrench in gaining 51.5% from its current level to $1 trillion in market cap by 2030.\n\nNetflix's road to $1 trillion won't be easy\n\nNetflix is the second-best performing Ten Titan year to date behind only Oracle.ORCL data by YCharts.\n\nEpic gains over the last few years have lifted Netflix's market cap to $515.8 billion at the time of this writing. But the company has a longer way to go than Oracle to reach $1 trillion by 2030. Specifically, the stock would have to achieve a compound annual gain of 14.2% between now and August 2030 to surpass a $1 trillion market cap. For context, the S&P 500 has historically averaged an annual gain of 9% to 10% per year, but that comes with a lot of variance.\n\nDespite the uphill climb, Netflix thinks it can hit the mark. Management has set an internal goal to hit $1 trillion market cap by 2030, as well as doubling revenue and tripling operating income from 2024 levels, giving Netflix a projected $78 billion in revenue and a 40% operating margin for roughly $31 billion in operating income. At a $1 trillion market cap, that would put Netflix's valuation at 32.3 times operating income, which is expensive considering operating income doesn't even account for taxes.\n\nNetflix's road to $1 trillion requires the company to hit its internal goals and maintain its premium valuation. However, Netflix has done a masterful job refining its secret sauce for content quality and quantity while managing spending. So it's reasonable to assume the company should be able to grow its margins over time.\n\nInvesting in Ten Titans for the right reasons\n\nThe Ten Titans have delivered market-beating returns over the long term. But the group's valuation is relatively stretched, so the \"easy\" gains are likely in the rearview. This means these stocks will have to rely on earnings growth, rather than earnings growth and valuation expansion, to drive future returns.\n\nThe S&P 500's valuation has gone up, and its yield has gone down as the Titans gobble up a higher percentage of the index. Investors should understand that the Ten Titans' influence on the index is a double-edged sword. When earnings are good and optimism is running high, the Ten Titans can drive the market to new heights. But when fear creeps in, the Titans can accelerate a rapid sell-off -- as we saw in April.\n\nI believe Oracle and Netflix will one day reach $1 trillion market caps, but there's a lot that could go wrong between now and 2030 to delay that ascent. So investors considering either name should only do so with a long-term mindset and a relatively high risk tolerance.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Oracle right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Oracle, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Oracle wasn’t one of them.

Continue »\n\nFast forward seven years, and there are nine S&P 500(SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) components with market caps over $1 trillion:  the \"Magnificent Seven\" consisting of Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT), Apple, Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN), Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL), Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META), and Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA), plus Broadcom(NASDAQ: AVGO) and Berkshire Hathaway(NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B).\n\nThe \"Ten Titans\" include the ten largest growth-focused companies by market cap -- the Magnificent Seven and Broadcom, Oracle(NYSE: ORCL), and Netflix(NASDAQ: NFLX).\n\nHere's how Oracle and Netflix can join the rest of the Ten Titans in the $1 trillion club by 2030.\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nOracle is a high-risk, high-potential-reward AI play\n\nOracle's market cap at the time of this writing is $660.2 billion. Oracle has gone from a dividend-paying tech stalwart to a business unlocking transformational growth in just a matter of years. And investors have responded, as Oracle is up a staggering 70% in the last year and 318% in the last five years.\n\nOracle's cloud business is growing faster than incumbents Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud, as Oracle has done a masterful job leveraging cloud with its established data center model, implementing a competitive pricing model, and forming partnerships with the major cloud providers.\n\nOracle is pricey, at 34.6 times forward earnings estimates, making it more expensive than the larger, more established cloud players. However, Oracle has a number of advantages that could pole vault its market cap well above $1 trillion by 2030.\n\nTSLA PE Ratio (Forward) data by YCharts.\n\nFor starters, Oracle is a pure play enterprise software and solutions company. Unlike Amazon, Microsoft, and Alphabet -- which are basically tech conglomerates -- Oracle doesn't have a consumer-facing business. This gives Oracle a much more focused investment thesis and allows the company to zero in its capital expenditures (capex) on building out its cloud infrastructure and application network.\n\nOracle has been one of the most aggressive companies when it comes to deploying capex into artificial intelligence (AI). As you can see in the following chart, Oracle went from a company that was chugging along and maintaining its legacy business to pouring money into capex even though its operating income hasn't grown nearly as quickly.\n\nORCL Capital Expenditures (TTM) data by YCharts.\n\nIf Oracle's investments translate to earnings growth, the stock could defend its premium valuation and have an easy path to a $1 trillion market cap and beyond.\n\nHowever, it's worth mentioning that Oracle's balance sheet is highly leveraged with debt, and its free cash flow is negative as it front-loads AI investments.\n\nBuying Oracle is a bet that its ultra-aggressive capex spending is worth it. If it disappoints, Oracle stock could correct and remain beaten down for some time, which could throw a wrench in gaining 51.5% from its current level to $1 trillion in market cap by 2030.\n\nNetflix's road to $1 trillion won't be easy\n\nNetflix is the second-best performing Ten Titan year to date behind only Oracle.\n\nORCL data by YCharts.\n\nEpic gains over the last few years have lifted Netflix's market cap to $515.8 billion at the time of this writing. But the company has a longer way to go than Oracle to reach $1 trillion by 2030. Specifically, the stock would have to achieve a compound annual gain of 14.2% between now and August 2030 to surpass a $1 trillion market cap. For context, the S&P 500 has historically averaged an annual gain of 9% to 10% per year, but that comes with a lot of variance.\n\nDespite the uphill climb, Netflix thinks it can hit the mark. Management has set an internal goal to hit $1 trillion market cap by 2030, as well as doubling revenue and tripling operating income from 2024 levels, giving Netflix a projected $78 billion in revenue and a 40% operating margin for roughly $31 billion in operating income. At a $1 trillion market cap, that would put Netflix's valuation at 32.3 times operating income, which is expensive considering operating income doesn't even account for taxes.\n\nNetflix's road to $1 trillion requires the company to hit its internal goals and maintain its premium valuation. However, Netflix has done a masterful job refining its secret sauce for content quality and quantity while managing spending. So it's reasonable to assume the company should be able to grow its margins over time.\n\nInvesting in Ten Titans for the right reasons\n\nThe Ten Titans have delivered market-beating returns over the long term. But the group's valuation is relatively stretched, so the \"easy\" gains are likely in the rearview. This means these stocks will have to rely on earnings growth, rather than earnings growth and valuation expansion, to drive future returns.\n\nThe S&P 500's valuation has gone up, and its yield has gone down as the Titans gobble up a higher percentage of the index. Investors should understand that the Ten Titans' influence on the index is a double-edged sword. When earnings are good and optimism is running high, the Ten Titans can drive the market to new heights. But when fear creeps in, the Titans can accelerate a rapid sell-off -- as we saw in April.\n\nI believe Oracle and Netflix will one day reach $1 trillion market caps, but there's a lot that could go wrong between now and 2030 to delay that ascent. So investors considering either name should only do so with a long-term mindset and a relatively high risk tolerance.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Oracle right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Oracle, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Oracle wasn’t one of them.

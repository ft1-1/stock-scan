            "title": "What is driving the EV sales slowdown, according to one analyst",
            "content": "Sales of new electric vehicles are starting to slow. In the video above, RBC Capital Markets lead equity analyst for global autos Tom Narayan explains one thing that may be causing the slowdown.\n\nTo watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Market Domination.\n\nVideo Transcript\n\n00:00 Speaker A\n\nThe gap is widening between new and used EV prices, the report from our next guest showing that used EVs are selling at 45% discount compared to their new counterparts. We're navigating how to play the EV sector with the Yahoo Finance playbook and joining now got Tom Norion, lead equity analyst of Global Autos at RBC Capital Markets. Tom, it is great to see you. Uh you know, so we talk, Tom, about the EV slowdown. We'll talk about different factors, you know, maybe it's politics or or range worries, but you're focusing on a different variable, Tom, which is used prices for EVs. Walk us through it. What are you seeing there?\n\n00:50 Tom Norion\n\nYeah, it's interesting how this I think is being forgotten a lot by uh by the market and the media in some cases. There's a lot of focus on culture wars and range anxiety that gets a lot of attention. But when you really look at what's driving the EV slowdown, we think it has to do with used EV pricing being so much below new EV pricing. Uh so much so as you pointed out in that chart, it's like a 45% discount. If you can get a Tesla Model Y for $13,000, why would you buy one for 50, right? Um whereas on the ICE side, right? Internal combustion engine side, the discount between new and used is only about uh 25%. Uh so what we're noticing is really, and we're seeing it in the data, if you look at California vehicle sales in 2024, um the new EVs fell off in 24 versus 23, but used just absolutely spiked. Uh so much so so that you can't ignore that type of data. It's clear that what people are doing is they're seeing the deals that you can get on used EVs and they're buying the used EVs instead of the new EVs.\n\n02:53 Speaker A\n\nSo let me ask Tom, if that's the trend, then as investors, how do we want to be positioned to play that theme? Who are some of the winners you would call out from it?\n\n03:09 Tom Norion\n\nYeah, we think that what this trend means is that this EV slowdown has legs. It will likely continue, right? Because you're going to have new uh EV prices go up because of tariffs and whatnot. Also, you had a lot of people on leases, right? They leased an EV back in like 2022 post pandemic. Now it's 2025, three years have gone by and it's time to return that car and they're buying a used EV instead of a new EV. So we think this continues. Who do we like? We like the legacy OEMs. That's like Ford and GM who can sell internal combustion engine cars. Uh we like those guys. We also like auto suppliers that are tied to those legacy OEMs. Uh you know, suppliers that are tied to Ford and GM. Who are we worried about? It's the pure play EV guys. Maybe your Rivians, your Lucids, to a lesser extent Tesla, although we think that stock trades on other things. Um but really it's you want to own, I think, names that benefit from internal combustion engine uh sales and less so on companies that are completely dependent on EV sales.\n\n04:56 Speaker A\n\nBut correct me if I'm wrong, Tom. GM and Ford, do you I thought you had a you had an outperform on GM and a sector perform on Ford. Is that still the case? And if so, how come?\n\n05:15 Tom Norion\n\nYeah, that's true. Um and that's a lot of that just has to do with kind of comparing the two against each other. Um we tend to we do we do like GM uh more than Ford right now for for a number of thing reasons, but the thesis on Ford, we're kind of warming up a little bit to it, honestly. Um and a lot of it has to do with this dynamic itself. The fact that the EV slowdown continues. Now they can they don't have to sell as many EVs. They can sell more large SUVs and pickup trucks which are cash machines. So if that continues, we could change our view on Ford potentially. Right now, it's just more of a relative bias towards uh GM right now, but that's definitely warming up.\n\n06:22 Speaker A\n\nAnd you also talked time there. I heard you mention the names you thought, okay, that could be disadvantaged by this EV slowdown and you mentioned some of those pure play EV names, the Lucid, the Rivian. But I know you still like Tesla. Why do you still like Tesla here, Tom? Is that is that the new affordable model on the way in Q4? Is it the robotaxi play? Explain it to us.\n\n07:00 Tom Norion\n\nYeah, I think this one has less to do with cars at all, right? And it's very much to do with the robo taxi. Also, you know what's been really, I'm getting calls on a lot lately is humanoid robots. Um you know, if you asked me this, I think you did ask me this maybe a few months ago, I would have been like, you know, I don't know. I need to do some work on it. But the more I'm reading on it, the more the market seems to be warming up to obviously AI and on this humanoid robot topic. Um this has some legs too. So I think the reason why I like Tesla is I do think there's a lot of growth here um in non-cars. Um so while I am worried for them on car sales because of the EV slowdown, I do think especially from the retail investor point of view, um there's a lot to potentially like on the AI play, especially with robo taxi and this humanoid robot thing.

            "content": "Parag Agrawal, the former Twitter CEO ousted after Elon Musk's 2022 takeover, has reemerged in Silicon Valley with Parallel Web Systems, a startup promising to push artificial intelligence beyond current limits.\n\nThe company raised $30 million from Khosla Ventures, Index Ventures, and First Round Capital to launch its flagship product, the Deep Research application programming interface, Entrepreneur reports.\n\nDeep Research API Targets Benchmarks Against GPT-5\n\nParallel's Deep Research API already handles millions of requests daily, ranging from document discovery to code debugging and workflow automation. According to Entrepreneur, the system integrates eight research engines designed for specific functions like long-form synthesis, cross-disciplinary analysis, and knowledge retrieval.\n\nDon't Miss:\n\nThe same firms that backed Uber, Venmo and eBay are investing in this pre-IPO company disrupting a $1.8T market — and you can too at just $2.90/share. Kevin O'Leary Says Real Estate's Been a Smart Bet for 200 Years — This Platform Lets Anyone Tap Into It\n\nBenchmark tests published by the company claim the system has already outperformed OpenAI's GPT-5 on research-oriented tasks that require multi-step reasoning and contextual synthesis.\n\nOn BrowseComp, which measures how well systems navigate the live web to answer open-ended questions, Parallel reached 58% accuracy compared with GPT-5's 41% and a human baseline of 25%. On DeepResearch Bench, which evaluates long-form research tasks across 22 fields, Parallel achieved an 82% win rate against the reference standard, surpassing GPT-5's 66%.\n\nParallel Web Systems attributes this performance to infrastructure built from the ground up for AI agents, delivering structured, verifiable, and real-time results.\n\nIndependent reviews remain limited, but Entrepreneur says demonstrations show the product can manage complex queries, execute multi-hop reasoning, and generate outputs with factual provenance.\n\nTrending: 7 Million Gamers Already Trust Gameflip With Their Digital Assets — Now You Can Own a Stake in the Platform\n\nA ‘Programmatic Web' Built for AI Agents\n\nPalo Alto-based Parallel Web Systems describes its mission as preparing for a shift where AI agents become the primary users of the web. \"AIs will use the web far more than humans ever have,\" the company wrote in the announcement.\n\nThe firm advocates for a \"programmatic web\" designed specifically for machine consumption, built with declarative interfaces, transparent attribution, and value-driven open markets where sources and contributors are directly credited. Parallel Web Systems argues that the existing web, optimized for human clicks and ad impressions, cannot adequately serve AI systems that need scalable access to factual information.\n\nStory continues\n\nPotential applications of this model extend to legal analysis, market intelligence, and scientific research, where Entrepreneur says autonomous systems need reliable access to live data rather than static training sets. Parallel emphasizes system and organization controls 2 Type 2 certification, and enterprise readiness to meet developer demands across industries.\n\nSee Also: 2,000 High Earners Manage $6B With This AI Platform — Learn More\n\nAgrawal's Second Act in Tech\n\nAgrawal's exit from Twitter came after months of conflict with Musk. In 2022, Musk accused Twitter of misleading shareholders and tried to walk away from his $44 billion acquisition. Twitter's board sued Musk to enforce the deal, a legal battle that Agrawal was forced to fight while still leading the company.\n\nThe first thing Musk did after closing the purchase was fire most of the executive team, including Agrawal, without severance. Friends and colleagues urged Agrawal to take a break, but Bloomberg says he instead returned to Palo Alto, where he spent his time reading research papers, writing code, and considering what to build next.\n\nAgrawal views Parallel as a chance to define himself beyond Twitter, telling Bloomberg, \"I don't think Twitter defines me. If I do a good job, I'm hoping this company will define me.\"\n\nRead Next: Shaquille O'Neal Wants People to Take Heart Health Seriously — This AI-ECG Could Make That Easier\n\nImage: Shutterstock\n\nUNLOCKED: 5 NEW TRADES EVERY WEEK.

Reference actual numbers in your reasoning.\n\n3. **Consistency**: Apply the same scoring standards regardless of the stock. A score of 85 should represent the same quality level across all analyses.\n\n4. **Risk Focus**: Pay special attention to red flags that could invalidate the opportunity (poor liquidity, imminent earnings, deteriorating fundamentals).\n\n5. **Strategy Alignment**: Consider how well this opportunity fits options strategies (directional bias, volatility conditions, time decay considerations).\n\n6. **Completeness Check**: If critical data is missing, note it in your analysis but don't penalize the opportunity excessively for data gaps.\n\nAnalyze the TSLA opportunity now using this framework and respond with the required JSON format.",

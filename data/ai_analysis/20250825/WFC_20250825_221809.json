Murphy, Author and Lifestyle Expert partners with DS Simon Media, Converse, Five Star®, Melissa & Doug, Prodigy Education, and Sony Interactive Entertainment.\n\nNEW YORK, Aug.  25, 2025  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- With back-to-school season in full swing, parents are searching for smart, budget-friendly, and creative ways to get their kids ready for the year ahead. Author and Lifestyle Expert, Meaghan B. Murphy is partnering with leading brands to help families combine style, learning, and fun into their back-to-school prep.\n\nLEARNING ABOUT THE WORLD THROUGH PLAY\n\n“There’s a lot going on in the news and on social media, and it can be difficult for kids to understand,” says Murphy. For that reason, PlayStation’s new Climate Station is a great way to introduce students to real-world issues like climate change in a way that’s engaging and easy to understand.\n\nThe free Climate Station educational app, available now on PlayStation 5 and PlayStation VR2, combines more than 100 years of scientific data from NASA and other scientific organizations with immersive game technology to tell the story of the forces shaping our world. Students can explore the causes and effects of climate change while learning how to help prevent certain outcomes.\n\nDirect Link: https://www.playstation.com/en-ca/games/climate-station/\n\nSocial Media Handles:\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/playstation/\r\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/playstation/\r\nX: https://x.com/PlayStation\n\nSTEP INTO STYLE\n\n“This year, retro-inspired sneakers are trending, and they never go out of style,” says Murphy. Converse is making a statement this season with the playful Chuck Taylor All Star Double Stack, available in both high and low-top cuts, including a classic plaid design. The Converse Classic Trainer, with its slimmed-down ’70s soccer style and suede upper, is perfect for school uniforms and everyday wear.\n\nVisit Converse.com for more kids’ and adult styles, including Converse By You, which lets shoppers personalize their own sneakers.\n\nDirect Link: https://nike.box.com/s/agrtn8vt42he9r331c7iu7g3gonwkaxf\n\nSocial Media Handle: @converse\n\nTECH-SMART LEARNING TOOLS\n\nStudies show that handwriting activates more brain regions for memory and learning than typing. That is why Five Star® is bringing together traditional notetaking with modern digital tools.\n\nThe Five Star Study App, compatible with Five Star supplies, allows students to scan handwritten notes to create digital flashcards, organize assignments, and study anywhere. Five Star supplies are built to last all year, which helps families stretch their budgets.\n\nFor younger learners, Prodigy offers two free, immersive, game-based learning experiences, Prodigy Math for grades 1–8 and Prodigy English for grades 1–6, where kids complete educational quests while having fun. It was recently voted kids’ favorite educational game by KidSay Trent Report. Murphy says these games were a staple in her household when her children were younger. The gaming aspect was always a bonus, “As the kids explore, battle, and build, they’re practicing real math or English skills, growing their confidence, and staying motivated to learn in school or at home.\n\nParents can also purchase optional memberships, which unlock additional in-game features and ways for families to stay more invested in their child’s learning journey.\n\nFive Star® Direct Link: www.fivestarbuiltstrong.com/notetaking-study-app/\n\nSocial Media Handles:\n\nFive Star® Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/FiveStar/\n\nFive Star® Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/meadfivestar\n\nFive Star® YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/meadfivestarchannel\n\nProdigy Direct Link: https://www.prodigygame.com/main-en/parents-learn-more-prices\n\nProdigy Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/ProdigyGame\n\nProdigy Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/prodigygame/?hl=en\n\nProdigy Pinterest: https://ca.pinterest.com/prodigygame/\n\nProdigy X: https://x.com/ProdigyGame\n\nHashtags: #BTSWithProdigy\n\nSCREEN-FREE FUN\n\nWith parents keeping a close eye on screen time, Melissa & Doug offers developmental, screen-free toys to spark creativity. Murphy highlights the brand’s 19-piece wooden vending machine play set, which encourages sorting, counting, letter recognition, and imaginative play. It can also be used as a reward system when stocked with small treats or trinkets, making it a fun way to teach cause-and-effect. The lifestyle expert adds, “Kids can insert play coins and make a selection by pressing the corresponding button, and watch items fall into the collection drawer.”\n\nLearn more about the importance of open-ended, screen-free play and access free resources, like print-and-play activities, blog posts, and more, at MelissaAndDoug.com.\n\nDirect Link: https://www.melissaanddoug.com/products/sort-stock-select-vending-machine-play-set\n\nSocial Media Handles:\n\nFacebook: @melissaanddoug\r\nInstagram: @melissaanddougtoys\r\nX: @melissaanddoug\n\nHashtag: #melissaanddoug\n\nMedia Contact:\r\nMichael O’Donnell\r\nD S Simon Media\r\n212-736-2727\r\nmodonnell@dssimon.com\n\nA video accompanying this announcement is available at https://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/c861ab0a-3106-4059-9b8d-8b464d993d9a",

            "title": "Fed Turns Dovish, Signals Upcoming Rate Cut: What This Means for Banks",
            "content": "At Jackson Hole, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell struck a more dovish tone, hinting that a rate cut could be on the horizon. He described the labor market as in a “curious balance,” wherein hiring is slowing and the pool of available workers is shrinking due to demographic shifts and the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown.\n\nMarkets were already betting on lower rates, with the policy range currently at 4.25-4.5%. Weakening job data has only strengthened those expectations. According to the CME FedWatch tool, nearly 87% of traders now see a 25-basis-point cut in September as the most likely outcome.\n\nStocks rallied on Powell’s remarks. During Friday’s trading session, the KBW Nasdaq Bank Index jumped 3.2%, the Dow Jones gained 1.9% and major banks advanced — Citigroup C up 2.9%, Bank of America BAC 2.5%, JPMorgan Chase JPM 2.1% and Wells Fargo WFC 1.6%.\n\nReasons for Signalling Rate Cut\n\nRising Risks in the Labor Market: Powell highlighted that while unemployment remains low, both hiring and labor supply are slipping, raising the risks of sudden layoffs or rising joblessness. Even a modest slowdown may trigger layoffs and rising unemployment, prompting the central bank to take a dovish stance to cushion the economy before those risks materialize.\n\nBalancing Inflation & Growth: While inflation remains above the Fed’s 2% target, Powell signaled a shift in priorities. Earlier in the tightening cycle, the Fed was willing to slow growth to bring prices down. Now, protecting jobs and sustaining economic momentum appear to outweigh the risk of inflation staying sticky. In effect, the Fed’s reaction function has turned more dovish, with greater sensitivity to weakening growth than to lingering price pressures.\n\nFinancial Conditions & Credit Flows: Beyond inflation and employment, elevated borrowing costs have strained both households and businesses, especially those with debt maturing after years of near-zero rates. Prolonged high interest rates risk dampening credit flows, stifling business investment and curbing consumer demand. By lowering rates, the Fed aims to ease financing pressures and prevent a slowdown in lending activity, which is critical to sustaining overall economic growth.\n\nHow Are Banks Likely to be Affected?\n\nThe Fed’s rate reductions, already totaling 100 basis points in 2024, have begun to stabilize funding costs, particularly deposit costs that had been rising during the tightening cycle. Any further rate cut will support net interest income (NII) expansion, a critical earnings driver for banks such as WFC, C, BAC and JPM. While lower benchmark rates can compress yields on loans and securities, the easing of funding pressures helps preserve margins.\n\nStory Continues\n\nLower rates also relieve financial stress for borrowers. Many households and businesses took on debt during the near-zero interest rate era and are now facing maturities at significantly higher costs. A rate cut makes refinancing more affordable, reducing the risks of defaults. This, in turn, can help banks improve credit quality and limit the need for higher loan-loss provisions.\n\nAlso, it is expected to encourage consumers and businesses to borrow. Such increased lending activity can result in larger profitability for banks as they earn more interest on these loans.\n\nDespite these positives, the full impact will not be immediate. Loan growth and improved asset quality take time to work through balance sheets, while margin compression may still weigh on near-term earnings. As a result, investors should expect a gradual rather than an immediate improvement in bank profitability.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

            "title": "Do Wells Fargo's (NYSE:WFC) Earnings Warrant Your Attention?",
            "content": "The excitement of investing in a company that can reverse its fortunes is a big draw for some speculators, so even companies that have no revenue, no profit, and a record of falling short, can manage to find investors. Unfortunately, these high risk investments often have little probability of ever paying off, and many investors pay a price to learn their lesson. Loss making companies can act like a sponge for capital - so investors should be cautious that they're not throwing good money after bad.\n\nIf this kind of company isn't your style, you like companies that generate revenue, and even earn profits, then you may well be interested in Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC). While this doesn't necessarily speak to whether it's undervalued, the profitability of the business is enough to warrant some appreciation - especially if its growing.\n\nThis technology could replace computers: discover the 20 stocks are working to make quantum computing a reality.\n\nHow Quickly Is Wells Fargo Increasing Earnings Per Share?\n\nGenerally, companies experiencing growth in earnings per share (EPS) should see similar trends in share price. Therefore, there are plenty of investors who like to buy shares in companies that are growing EPS. Over the last three years, Wells Fargo has grown EPS by 13% per year. That's a pretty good rate, if the company can sustain it.\n\nIt's often helpful to take a look at earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) margins, as well as revenue growth, to get another take on the quality of the company's growth. It's noted that Wells Fargo's revenue from operations was lower than its revenue in the last twelve months, so that could distort our analysis of its margins. Wells Fargo reported flat revenue and EBIT margins over the last year. That's not bad, but it doesn't point to ongoing future growth, either.\n\nYou can take a look at the company's revenue and earnings growth trend, in the chart below.

But thanks to their investment in the company, it's pleasing to see that there are still incentives to align their actions with the shareholders. We note that their impressive stake in the company is worth US$323m. While that is a lot of skin in the game, we note this holding only totals to 0.1% of the business, which is a result of the company being so large. So despite their percentage holding being low, company management still have plenty of reasons to deliver the best outcomes for investors.\n\nStory Continues\n\nShould You Add Wells Fargo To Your Watchlist?\n\nOne important encouraging feature of Wells Fargo is that it is growing profits. If that's not enough on its own, there is also the rather notable levels of insider ownership. These two factors are a huge highlight for the company which should be a strong contender your watchlists. You should always think about risks though. Case in point, we've spotted  1 warning sign for Wells Fargo you should be aware of.\n\nAlthough Wells Fargo certainly looks good, it may appeal to more investors if insiders were buying up shares.

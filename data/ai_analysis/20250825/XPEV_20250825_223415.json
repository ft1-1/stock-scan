            "content": "We recently published 10 Stocks Defy Chaos With Jaw-Dropping Gains. XPeng Inc. (NYSE:XPEV) is one of the top performers of last week.\n\nChinese electric vehicle maker XPeng Inc. (NYSE:XPEV) grew its share price by 20.56 percent week-on-week as investors cheered the company’s highly optimistic growth outlook for the third quarter, while taking path from an investment firm’s bullish rating for its stock.\n\nLast week, XPeng Inc. (NYSE:XPEV) said it was targeting to grow its revenues by 94 percent to 107.9 percent year-on-year to between RMB19.6 billion and RMB21 billion in the third quarter, as it expected to deliver between 113,000 and 118,000 vehicles, or a year-on-year growth of 142.8 percent to 153.6 percent.XPeng (XPEV) Climbs 20% on Whopping Q3 Revenue Growth Expectations\n\nThis followed its stellar earnings performance in the second quarter, having narrowed its net loss attributable to shareholders by 62.5 percent to RMB480 million from RMB1.28 billion in the same period last year, thanks to a 147-percent expansion in vehicle sales of RMB16.88 billion versus only RMB6.82 billion in the same comparable period.\n\nFollowing the results, investment firm HSBC, in a market note on Friday, gave XPeng Inc. (NYSE:XPEV) a “buy” recommendation with a new price target of $29.6, higher than the $27.4 price target previously. The figure marked a 24.6-percent upside potential from its latest closing price.\n\nWhile we acknowledge the potential of XPEV as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and have limited downside risk. If you are looking for an extremely cheap AI stock that is also a major beneficiary of Trump tariffs and onshoring, see our free report on the best short-term AI stock.\n\nView Comments",

With XOS 5.8.0, the third major OTA release of 2025 following the widely acclaimed versions XOS 5.4.5 in January and XOS 5.6.0 in May. Each of these releases raised application standards in safety, personalization, and driving assistance.\n\nThe XOS 5.8.0 OTA upgrade powerfully demonstrates XPENG's promise: to listen closely to user feedback and respond quickly to market expectations. As XPENG continues to expand the suite of intelligent features, XPENG is pioneering new pathways for the global electric vehicle industry.\n\nIntelligent Driving Upgrade: New Human-Machine Co-Pilot Feature\n\nWith XOS 5.8.0, XPENG becomes the first and only automaker in Europe to offer standard Human-Machine Co-Driving.\n\nWhen Lane Centering Control (LCC) is active, the system now shares control with the driver. Rather than disengaging when the driver steers, LCC remains active, resulting in smoother, more natural driving assistance. LCC also demonstrates improved performance in complex scenarios such as highway merges and exits, with reduced steering oscillation.\n\nApart from that, Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) has been significantly enhanced for higher cornering speeds and more comfortable deceleration.\n\nIntroducing Pet Mode\n\nDesigned for pet-loving families, the new Pet Mode, ensures safety and comfort when pets are left unattended briefly. Windows close automatically, doors lock, and the climate system maintains a comfortable temperature and air circulation.\n\nThe AUTO Climate Control Mode with external air circulation prevents overheating or excessive cold. Owners will receive real-time alerts via the XPENG app and can remotely activate or deactivate the mode. This feature enhances safety for users who need to briefly leave their pets in the car.\n\nHands-Free In-Car Karaoke with KaraFun\n\nThis OTA upgrade brings the new KaraFun feature. Users can simply download KaraFun from the in-car App Store to start enjoying it.\n\nGlobally Tailored Comfort & Safety\n\nXPENG has always remained committed to a user-centric philosophy, delivering intelligent technology experiences tailored to its customers. Through this OTA upgrade, owners can enjoy a smarter and more personalized charging experience. In response to feedback from users in tropical climates, the air conditioning minimum temperature has been lowered to 16°C for enhanced comfort. The Dashcam function is now available in more European countries, with added Emergency Recording for greater peace of mind.\n\nThis iteration also brings an upgrade to XCOMBO, which now supports 21 languages and offers over 700 atomic capabilities for an intelligent and highly personalized experience. Users can easily create and edit customized scenarios through the in-car display or the mobile app, truly enabling “a unique journey for every individual.”\n\nAt the same time, with a wide range of official preset scenarios, users can switch between modes for entertainment, safety, comfort, energy saving, and more. All with a single tap, creating a truly personalized smart cockpit experience.\n\nWith the rollout of XOS 5.8.0, XPENG creates a more diverse, convenient, and intelligent mobility space for our users worldwide. We will continue listening closely to our global community, ensuring that every evolution of XPENG technology remains driven by your needs and aspirations.\n\n*Features, availability, and functionality of the OTA update may vary depending on the vehicle model and local regulations in different markets.\n\nAbout XPENG\r\nFounded in 2014, XPENG is a leading Chinese AI-driven mobility company that designs, develops, manufactures, and markets Smart EVs, catering to a growing base of tech-savvy consumers.

Reference actual numbers in your reasoning.\n\n3. **Consistency**: Apply the same scoring standards regardless of the stock. A score of 85 should represent the same quality level across all analyses.\n\n4. **Risk Focus**: Pay special attention to red flags that could invalidate the opportunity (poor liquidity, imminent earnings, deteriorating fundamentals).\n\n5. **Strategy Alignment**: Consider how well this opportunity fits options strategies (directional bias, volatility conditions, time decay considerations).\n\n6. **Completeness Check**: If critical data is missing, note it in your analysis but don't penalize the opportunity excessively for data gaps.\n\nAnalyze the XPEV opportunity now using this framework and respond with the required JSON format.",

            "title": "Better Fintech Stock: Block vs. PayPal",
            "content": "Key Points\n\nBlock is putting up double-digit gross profit growth, but Bitcoin could drive results in the future. PayPal's stock has taken a beating, but the business still rakes in plenty of free cash flow. Investors should decide which stock to buy based on their risk tolerance. 10 stocks we like better than PayPal ›\n\nIt's been a disappointing year for these two companies. As of Aug. 21, Block (NYSE: XYZ) shares have tanked 13% in 2025. PayPal (NASDAQ: PYPL) has fared worse, with its shares down 21% this year. If that weren't bad enough, both are trading more than 70% below their all-time highs, a gut-wrenching reality that might scare most investors away.\n\nBut to be clear, both companies have positive attributes. Between Block and PayPal, which is the better fintech stock to buy? Image source: Getty Images.\n\nBlock's two ecosystems continue to grow\n\nBlock operates two successful ecosystems that can be viewed as separate businesses. Square posted 11% gross profit growth last quarter (Q2 2025, ended June 30), offering tools and services to merchants. Cash App, which serves individuals, is growing at a faster clip. And it has 57 million monthly active users.\n\nThe business continues to innovate to drive further growth. For instance, Square AI gives merchants access to valuable data insights. And Cash App Borrow, a short-term lending product, saw originations rise 95% year over year. Block's expansion playbook is focused on introducing new products and services to bring more merchants and consumers into the fold. Then it's about boosting use and monetization.\n\nLooking ahead, it's clear that Bitcoin will slowly become a bigger factor in Block's success. Founder and CEO Jack Dorsey is very bullish on this crypto. And he has overseen new projects, like the development of a hardware wallet and mining equipment, to further accelerate Bitcoin's adoption. Should the digital asset continue on its impressive trajectory, this could be a boon for Block over the long term.\n\nPayPal has long been a leader in digital payments\n\nPayPal has a presence in more than 200 countries across the globe. It handled $443 billion in total payment volume in the second quarter (ended June 30). And it counts 438 million active users. This scale demonstrates just how important PayPal is in the world of online commerce. And with its two-sided platform, PayPal benefits from a network effect.\n\nBut the company has dealt with slower growth in recent years, which prompted a leadership change. Alex Chriss, who has been CEO since September 2023, is doing a good job so far of righting the ship. He has brought innovation back to the forefront.\n\nStory Continues\n\nFor instance, a key recent initiative is PayPal World. Set to launch later this year, it's a global platform that will connect different digital wallets and payment systems. This could provide a more seamless experience. PayPal also has its own stablecoin, called PYUSD, to lower costs and speed up transactions.\n\nUnder Chriss, PayPal is also better monetizing its Venmo segment, which essentially competes directly with Block's Cash App. Venmo is trying to become more than a peer-to-peer payment service, for example, with its very popular debit card. Venmo posted greater-than-20% revenue growth in Q2, better than that of the company overall.\n\nDespite the stock's performance, PayPal operates from a position of financial strength. Earnings per share calculated according to generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) soared 20% in Q2. Free cash flow is expected to be $6 billion to $7 billion for the full year.\n\nThe final verdict\n\nThere's no denying that both of these companies have established themselves as powerful forces in the fintech industry. Block operates with a bigger presence in physical commerce, while PayPal leads in online payments. Nonetheless, both of these businesses face a lot of competition.\n\nInvestors who have a higher risk tolerance might want to consider Block. The company's focus on Bitcoin activities adds upside, but it also introduces uncertainty, as ultimate success isn't guaranteed. On the other hand, investors who want to own a financially sound digital payments powerhouse will favor PayPal. The company's much cheaper forward price-to-earnings ratio of 12.9 is also hard to overlook.\n\nAnd, of course, those who want more exposure to the fintech space could choose to own both of these stocks.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in PayPal right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in PayPal, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and PayPal wasn’t one of them.

            "title": "Scale and Integration of PayPal's BNPL: Will it Outpace Competitors?",
            "content": "PayPal Holdings PYPL’s Buy Now, Pay Later (BNPL) offering continues to stand out as a key growth driver within its branded checkout ecosystem. In the second quarter of 2025, BNPL total payment volume rose more than 20% year over year, while monthly active accounts expanded 18%. The solution is now available in nine global markets and is automatically integrated wherever PayPal is accepted, providing unmatched distribution without additional merchant integration costs. This scale advantage positions PayPal as the most broadly available BNPL provider in its largest markets.\r\n\r\nThe economics of BNPL are also attractive. PayPal disclosed that transactions completed with BNPL result in average order values more than 80% higher than standard branded checkout. This lifts merchant sales and creates incremental revenue opportunities. Retailers who highlight BNPL at the product page level, such as Ace Hardware, have reported a 35% increase in PayPal sales and a sevenfold increase in order size, demonstrating the strong conversion potential of the product.\r\n\r\nBeyond e-commerce, PayPal is extending BNPL into omnichannel. Its “Pay Later To Go” product, launched in Germany, enables installment payments in physical stores across multiple durations. This expansion reinforces PayPal’s ambition to capture everyday spending, not just online discretionary purchases, and adds a competitive edge as BNPL moves closer to mainstream credit alternatives.\r\n\r\nStill, risks remain. Standalone BNPL providers are innovating aggressively, while Apple’s entry raises competitive intensity. Additionally, a weaker consumer backdrop could weigh on repayment trends and dampen growth.\r\n\r\nPayPal’s BNPL strategy offers meaningful upside through scale, integration, and merchant value creation, but competition and credit risks warrant ongoing investor attention.\n\nHow Are Block and Affirm Doing in the BNPL Space?\n\nBlock XYZ continues expanding its BNPL capabilities via Afterpay, integrating installment options directly into Cash App and retroactively for past purchases. In second-quarter 2025, its BNPL Gross Merchandise Value (GMV) grew 17% year over year to $9.11 billion, while Cash App’s gross profit per active user rose 15%. Notably, 96% of installments were paid on time, and 98% incurred no late fees. Moreover, more than 95% of Afterpay GMV came from returning customers.\r\n\r\nAffirm Holdings, Inc. AFRM noted that in the last reported quarter, most of the transactions came from repeat transactions. It showcases the trust and loyalty of its customers. In the third quarter of fiscal 2025, total transactions rose 45.6% year over year to 31.3 million on the back of a 94% repeat rate. It has recently expanded its partnership with Stripe to become the first BNPL provider to be directly integrated into Stripe Terminal, the point-of-sale (POS) system used by more than a million in-store locations across the United States and Canada. This means shoppers paying in physical stores through Stripe’s POS devices can now choose Affirm at checkout.\n\nStory Continues\n\nPYPL’s Price Performance, Valuation and Estimates\n\nShares of PayPal have plunged 20.9% year to date, underperforming both the broader industry and the S&P 500 Index.Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nFrom a valuation standpoint, PayPal shares are trading cheap, as suggested by the Value Score of A. In terms of forward 12-month P/E, PYPL stock is trading at 12.13X compared with the Zacks Financial Transaction Services industry’s 22.17X.Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nPayPal’s estimate revisions reflect a positive trend. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2025 earnings is pegged at $5.22 per share, suggesting 12.3% growth over 2024, while the same for 2026 stands at $5.77, calling for 10.5% growth year over year.Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nAt present, PayPal carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

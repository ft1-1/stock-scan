This came ahead of the company’s Q2 2025 results, announced on July 31.\n\nThe investment firm expressed its confidence in the company’s earnings while remaining cautious about the uranium market, amid rising spot prices and subdued year-to-date term contracting. Furthermore, Canaccord expects Cameco Corporation (NYSE:CCJ)’s Westinghouse segment to remain a critical growth driver.\n\nLooking ahead, the analyst remains confident in Cameco Corporation (NYSE:CCJ)’s strategic positioning and long-term prospects amid rising demand for nuclear energy.\n\nCameco Corporation (NYSE:CCJ) is a leading uranium producer and nuclear services provider. It is one of the unstoppable stocks.\n\nWhile we acknowledge the potential of CCJ as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk. If you're looking for an extremely undervalued AI stock that also stands to benefit significantly from Trump-era tariffs and the onshoring trend, see our free report on the best short-term AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 11 Best Gold Penny Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds and 11 Best Rebound Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds.\n\nDisclosure: None.\n\n查看留言",

Finally, uranium prices are on the rise. 10 stocks we like better than Cameco ›\n\nShares of Cameco (NYSE: CCJ), a Canadian uranium mining company, jumped 3.9% through noon ET on Friday -- and the reason is anybody's guess.\n\nThat's not to say there's no reason for Cameco stock to be up today. Rather, there are multiple reasons -- and you can take your pick which one you favor.Image source: Getty Images.\n\nReason 1: The Fed\n\nThe biggest reason, and the reason why most stocks are going up today, is glaringly obvious. Out in Wyoming, at the Jackson Hole Federal Reserve conference, Fed Chair Jerome Powell just told investors that because of a weakening economic outlook and tepid job growth, the Fed might decide to lower interest rates in September as investors, and President Donald Trump, have been asking it to do.\n\nInterest rate hikes are generally considered good for stocks and, well, Cameco is a stock.\n\nReason 2: Wall Street\n\nTwo different analysts have raised their price targets for Cameco stock over the past two days. According to StreetInsider.com, Raymond James hiked Cameco stock to 120 Canadian dollars yesterday, and today, National Bank Financial hiked it to CA$115.\n\nNeither bank gave us much of an explanation for hiking, but I think we can guess.\n\nReason 3: Uranium price\n\nUranium prices that plummeted in late June have been gradually rising ever since, and are currently up $3 per pound from their July 18 low. This is of course good news for a uranium stock like Cameco.\n\nIs Cameco stock a buy?\n\nStill, both prices and demand have to grow a lot to make this stock a buy. Cameco shares currently cost some 47 times trailing free cash flow, and their price-to-earnings ratio is an astounding 80.\n\nTo me, that sounds kind of expensive, but apparently I'm in the minority on that view today.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Cameco right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Cameco, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Cameco wasn’t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\n\nConsider when Netflix made this list on December 17, 2004... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $650,499!* Or when Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $1,072,543!*\n\nStory Continues\n\nNow, it’s worth noting Stock Advisor’s total average return is 1,045% — a market-crushing outperformance compared to 182% for the S&P 500.

He suggested NexGen Energy (TSX:NXE) and Denison Mines (NYSE:DNN) for those with higher risk tolerance looking for greater potential returns.\n\nSeveral uranium stocks posted significant gains in Friday trading. Cameco rose 3.7%, while Denison Mines added 3.3%.

Cameco Corporation (NYSE:CCJ) is one of Wednesday’s worst performers.\n\nCameco Corp. extended losses to a second day on Wednesday, shedding 4.54 percent to close at $70.47 apiece, as investors appeared to be in a wait-and-see mode for updates on the geopolitical front, alongside macroeconomic uncertainties surrounding the uranium industry.\n\nCameco Corporation (NYSE:CCJ) dropped alongside its counterparts as investors unloaded positions while waiting for developments on the Russia-Ukraine potential ceasefire that could stamp out the possibility of sanctions on the latter’s strategic nuclear sector.Cameco (CCJ) Extends Losses on Higher Uranium Production Expectations\n\nImage by Markus Distelrath from Pixabay\n\nWithout such sanctions, US uranium producers would remain in cut-throat competition with Russian suppliers.\n\nEarlier this week, uranium stocks also took a beating from news that Kazakhstan—the world’s largest uranium producer—is ramping up production of uranium products.\n\nThrough KATKO, a joint venture with France’s Orano Mining, Kazakhstan is planning to scale production back up to 4,000 metric tons per year, a level it last touched in 2021 after slashing output by 2,000 tons between 2017 and 2024 due to declining uranium prices.\n\nThe higher production is expected to begin as early as next year.\n\nWhile we acknowledge the potential of CCJ as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and have limited downside risk.

Reference actual numbers in your reasoning.\n\n3. **Consistency**: Apply the same scoring standards regardless of the stock. A score of 85 should represent the same quality level across all analyses.\n\n4. **Risk Focus**: Pay special attention to red flags that could invalidate the opportunity (poor liquidity, imminent earnings, deteriorating fundamentals).\n\n5. **Strategy Alignment**: Consider how well this opportunity fits options strategies (directional bias, volatility conditions, time decay considerations).\n\n6. **Completeness Check**: If critical data is missing, note it in your analysis but don't penalize the opportunity excessively for data gaps.\n\nAnalyze the CCJ opportunity now using this framework and respond with the required JSON format.",

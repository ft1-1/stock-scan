            "content": "Many small-cap stocks have limited Wall Street coverage, giving savvy investors the chance to act before everyone else catches on. But the flip side is that these businesses have increased downside risk because they lack the scale and staying power of their larger competitors.\n\nThe downside that can come from buying these securities is precisely why we started StockStory - to isolate the long-term winners from the losers so you can invest with confidence. Keeping that in mind, here is one small-cap stock that could be the next big thing and two that could be down big.\n\nTwo Small-Cap Stocks to Sell:\n\nCampbell's (CPB)\n\nMarket Cap: $9.88 billion\n\nWith its iconic canned soup as its cornerstone product, Campbell's (NASDAQ:CPB) is a packaged food company with an illustrious portfolio of brands.\n\nWhy Does CPB Give Us Pause?\n\nFalling unit sales over the past two years imply it may need to invest in product improvements to get back on track Demand will likely fall over the next 12 months as Wall Street expects flat revenue Expenses have increased as a percentage of revenue over the last year as its operating margin fell by 3.6 percentage points\n\nCampbell’s stock price of $33.18 implies a valuation ratio of 10.9x forward P/E. Read our free research report to see why you should think twice about including CPB in your portfolio, it’s free.\n\nPerdoceo Education (PRDO)\n\nMarket Cap: $2.17 billion\n\nFormerly known as Career Education Corporation, Perdoceo Education (NASDAQ:PRDO) is an educational services company that specializes in postsecondary education.\n\nWhy Are We Wary of PRDO?\n\nLackluster 2.9% annual revenue growth over the last two years indicates the company is losing ground to competitors Waning returns on capital imply its previous profit engines are losing steam\n\nPerdoceo Education is trading at $33 per share, or 21.3x forward EV-to-EBITDA. If you’re considering PRDO for your portfolio, see our FREE research report to learn more.\n\nOne Small-Cap Stock to Watch:\n\nOFG Bancorp (OFG)\n\nMarket Cap: $1.99 billion\n\nOriginally founded in 1964 as a federal savings and loan institution, OFG Bancorp (NYSE:OFG) provides banking and financial services including commercial and consumer lending, wealth management, insurance, and trust services primarily in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands.\n\nWhy Are We Fans of OFG?\n\nNon-interest operating profits and efficiency rose over the last four years as it benefited from some fixed cost leverage Share repurchases over the last two years enabled its annual earnings per share growth of 6.3% to outpace its revenue gains Balance sheet strength has increased this cycle as its 11.8% annual tangible book value per share growth over the last five years was exceptional\n\nStory Continues\n\nAt $44.81 per share, OFG Bancorp trades at 1.4x forward P/B.

            "content": "Chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA), the world's most valuable listed company, will be the focus for investors next week, with a range of other companies also due to report.\n\nExpectations have become increasingly high around Nvidia's results, so investors will be poring over the chipmaker's second quarter results on Wednesday, looking closely for any surprises to the upside or downside.\n\nAnother US tech company due to release results is computer maker Dell (DELL), which reported \"unprecedented demand\" for its artificial intelligence (AI) optimised servers in its last set of results.\n\nBack in London, insurance and asset management firm Prudential (PRU.L) is scheduled to report, with shares having continued to climb this year.\n\nIn the world of retail, investors will be looking at the latest results from JD Sports (JD.L), with shares facing pressure from concerns about the impacts of US president Donald Trump's tariffs.\n\nIn Germany, Delivery Hero (DHER.DE) is set to report first half results, having maintained full-year guidance on the back of a strong first quarter.\n\nHere's more on what to expect:\n\nNvidia (NVDA) – Reports second quarter results on Wednesday 27 AugustJensen Huang, CEO of Nvidia. 'Nvidia matters whether investors own it directly or not,' said AJ Bell's Danni Hewson and Dan Coatsworth.·picture alliance via Getty Images\n\nChipmaker Nvidia (NVDA), which is the world's biggest company with a stock market capitalisation of $4.3tn (£3.2tn), will be the last of the \"Magnificent 7\" tech behemoths to report this earnings season.\n\nGiven the company's size, AJ Bell's head of financial analysis Danni Hewson and investment analyst Dan Coatsworth said that in many ways \"Nvidia matters whether investors own it directly or not\".\n\nThey pointed out that the Mag 7 represent more than 35% of the market valuation of the S&P 500 (^GSPC) index and more than a fifth of the global stock market capitalisation, \"so if an investor owns an index tracker that follows either the S&P 500 or global benchmarks like the FTSE All-World then they will have exposure to Nvidia.\"\n\n\"Right now, they – or at least Nvidia, Meta (META), Microsoft (MSFT) and Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG) – are feeding off the splurge in AI-related spending,\" said Hewson and Coatsworth. \"The more the last three spend and promise returns from AI, the more the market likes it, and the more Nvidia likes it, as the company provides the processors that power the data centres that drive the large language models and effort to develop AGI and, to use [Meta CEO] Mark Zuckerberg’s new word, 'superintelligence'.\"\n\nThey said that estimates suggest that more than 40% of Nvidia's sales have come from Meta, Microsoft, Amazon (AMZN) and Alphabet. \"Thus, both the stock market and earnings are increasingly reliant upon a very small group of companies, notably Nvidia,\" they said.\n\nStory Continues\n\nStocks: Create your watchlist and portfolio\n\n\"The company does seem to have the happy knack of demolishing quarterly earnings estimates, even if some argue this is because chief executive Jensen Huang is smart enough to sandbag the forecasts,\" they said. \"The company even managed it in the first quarter, despite a $5bn charge relating to the loss of revenues in China, thanks to president Trump’s tariffs.\"\n\nIn the first quarter, Nvidia beat expectations, posting revenue of $44.1bn compared with an expected $43.29bn. The company reported adjusted adjusted earnings of $0.81 per share. Excluding a $4.5bn charge relating to US government requirements on exports of its H20 chips to China and related tax impacts, adjusted earnings were $0.96 per share.\n\nFor the second quarter, the chipmaker guided to revenue of $45bn, plus or minus 2% for the second quarter.\n\nHewson and Coatsworth said that analysts expect second quarter sales to come in at $45.8bn, representing growth of 52% year-on-year, as well as net income of $23.1bn and headline earnings per share of $1.\n\nInvestors will also be looking closely at the guidance Nvidia offers for the third quarter. Hewson and Coatsworth said that consensus estimates currently expect sales of $52.3bn, net income of $27.4bn and headline earnings per share of $1.16.\n\n\"Watch out also for any comments from Huang on the ongoing US-China trade talks, the deal cut with the Trump White House to cede 15% of all sales on H20 silicon chips into China to the US government and the lurking challenge posed to the more chips, more power, more capex model that is still posed by China’s DeepSeek,\" they added.\n\nNasdaqGS - Delayed Quote•USD\n\n(NVDA)\n\nFollow  View Quote Details\n\n174.98\n\n-0.42\n\n(-0.24%)\n\nAt close: August 21 at 4:00:00 PM EDT  Advanced Chart\n\nDell Technologies (DELL) – Reports second quarter results on Thursday 28 August\n\nDespite posting a mixed set of first quarter results in May, Dell (DELL) shares rose on the back of it reporting strong AI-demand and lifting its earnings forecast for the year.\n\nDell posted net revenue of $23.38bn for the first quarter, besting estimates of $23.15bn, though adjusted earnings per share of $1.55 came in shy of an expected $1.69.\n\nJeff Clarke, vice chairman and chief operating officer of Dell Technologies, said: \"We achieved first-quarter record servers and networking revenue of $6.3bn, and we’re experiencing unprecedented demand for our AI-optimized servers.\n\nRead more:Elon Musk may be banking on his UK energy plan to boost Tesla's fortunes\n\n\"We generated $12.1bn in AI orders this quarter alone, surpassing the entirety of shipments in all of FY25 and leaving us with $14.4bn in backlog.\"\n\nFor the second quarter, Dell said it expected revenue to be between $28.5bn and $29.5bn, which would be up 16% year over year at the midpoint of $29bn. Adjusted earnings per share are expected to be $2.25 at the midpoint, which would represent growth of 15%.\n\nFor the year, Dell guided to revenue of between $101bn and $105.0bn, which would be up 8% year over year at the midpoint of $103bn. The company lifted its adjusted earnings guidance for the year to $9.40 per share at the midpoint, up from a previous forecast of $9.30.\n\nNYSE - Delayed Quote•USD\n\n(DELL)\n\nFollow  View Quote Details\n\n127.83\n\n-0.65\n\n(-0.51%)\n\nAt close: August 21 at 4:00:02 PM EDT  Advanced Chart\n\nPrudential (PRU.L) – Reports half-year results on Wednesday 27 August\n\nShares in Prudential (PRU.L) are up 56.5% year-to-date, currently trading at their highest point in two years.\n\nRichard Hunter, head of markets at Interactive Investor, said: \"Now focused on Asia and Africa, the group is fully aware that such major continents bring significant opportunities. The combined populations of the two continents is around 4 billion, with an estimated $1tn of additional annual gross written premiums by 2033 being the addressable market.\n\n\"Given the recent weakness of consumer confidence in the region, it will be interesting to see whether, if customers are reluctant to spend, they have been saving instead.\"\n\nRead more: Analysts' top emerging market fund and trust picks\n\nHunter said that the group aims by 2027 are \"punchy\", including the target of achieving new business profit growth of between 15% and 20% annually, but added that \"even at this early stage Prudential is confident in achieving these goals\".\n\nIn its first quarter results at the end of April, Prudential reported new business profit of $608m, representing 12% growth on the same period last year.\n\n\"Elsewhere, the focus on digital distribution and the move towards more technology-based solutions continues apace, such as the increasing use of advanced analytics and AI for higher value purposes, which is being selectively trialled,\" said Hunter.\n\n\"Less positively, and from a broader perspective, heightened geopolitical tensions between the West and China cannot be overlooked, with Hong Kong the group’s biggest single country of profit generation during 2024 at $1.1bn.\"\n\nJD Sports (JD.L) – Releases second quarter trading update on Wednesday 27 August\n\nShares in sportswear retailer JD Sports (JD.L) have had a turbulent 2025 amid tariff uncertainty, with the stock down 3.7% year-to-date.\n\nMatt Britzman, senior equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said that the recent acquisition of American sporting goods retailer Hibbett has made the US JD’s biggest revenue contributor, now accounting for 37% of total sales.\n\n\"This increased exposure leaves the company vulnerable to higher import duties, particularly as most of its products are sourced from Asia,\" he said. \"As a result, JD faces rising cost pressures that will need to be carefully managed.\"\n\n\"Management expects profitability to be weighted toward the second half of the year, with current consensus pointing to full-year underlying pre-tax profit of around £890m ($1.19bn),\" said Britzman. \"Analysts will also keep a close eye on margin trends, particularly in the US, where JD has held firm on pricing despite aggressive discounting by competitors.\"\n\nLSE - Delayed Quote•USD\n\n(JD.L)\n\nFollow  View Quote Details\n\n92.28\n\n+0.34\n\n+(0.37%)\n\nAs of 12:55:45 PM GMT+1.

            "content": "Key Points\n\nTwo analysts sounded bearish notes on the alcoholic beverage purveyor. One went as far as to downgrade his recommendation on the shares.10 stocks we like better than Constellation Brands ›\n\nInvestors obviously weren't enjoying the taste of liquor conglomerate Constellation Brands(NYSE: STZ) on Tuesday. Following the lead of two analysts who became notably more bearish on the stock, they traded Constellation shares down by over 3% on the day. Meanwhile, the benchmark S&P 500 index landed in the black with a 0.4% increase.\n\nNot such a secure investment\n\nArguably the more influential of the pair of new analyst takes was that published by Bank of America Securities' Peter Galbo. In it, he downgraded his recommendation on Constellation stock to underperform (sell, in other words) from his previous neutral. He also knocked down his price target considerably, reducing it to $150 per share from the preceding $182.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now. Learn More »\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nAccording to reports, Galbo zeroed in particularly on the beer market, a crucial segment for the company. In his observation, beer consumption overall is falling, which doesn't bode well for a company so heavily invested in the category (its total beer sales in the latest reported quarter were $2.2 billion, against less than $281 million for wine and spirits).\n\nAdditionally, the analyst wrote, Constellation is facing a weakening of demand for alcoholic beverages in general. On a more positive note, he signaled that the company's robust cash flow and stock repurchases could help bolster the company's appeal.\n\nPlaced on watch\n\nGalbo's peer Filippo Falorni of Citigroup also weighed in on Constellation Tuesday, stating that his bank had opened a 30-day downside catalyst watch on the stock. He reiterated his rather lukewarm neutral recommendation on the beverage company, in addition to his $174 per-share price target.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Constellation Brands right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Constellation Brands, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Constellation Brands wasn’t one of them.

These ''units'' can be traded back and forth just like stocks, but can also be created or destroyed to accommodate investor demand.  Each week we monitor the week-over-week change in shares outstanding data, to keep a lookout for those ETFs experiencing notable inflows (many new units created) or outflows (many old units destroyed).  Creation of new units will mean the underlying holdings of the ETF need to be purchased, while destruction of units involves selling underlying holdings, so large flows can also impact the individual components held within ETFs.\n\nClick here to find out which 9 other ETFs experienced notable outflows »</p>\n\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.",

            "title": "JPMorgan's Liquidity Buffer: Paving the Way for Shareholder Rewards?",
            "content": "JPMorgan JPM, the largest U.S. bank, enjoys a strong liquidity position. As of June 30, 2025, cash and due from banks and deposits with banks were $420.3 billion. As of the same date, total debt was $485.1 billion (the majority of this is long-term in nature).\r\n\r\nAdditionally, JPM maintains investment-grade long-term credit ratings of A, AA- and A1 from Standard and Poor’s, Fitch Ratings and Moody’s Investors Service, respectively, and a stable outlook. Further, the company’s diversified, digitally enabled business model and structural deposit advantage underpin resilient earnings and enable robust capital returns. \r\n\r\nHence, the company’s enhanced capital return plan received the green signal from the Federal Reserve following the 2025 stress test. Also, effective Oct. 1, its preliminary stress capital buffer (SCB) will decline to 2.5% from the current 3.3%, a meaningful improvement for a systemically important financial institution like JPMorgan. The reduction strengthens flexibility by lowering the capital the bank must retain under adverse conditions.\r\n\r\nAs such, JPMorgan launched a new $50 billion share repurchase plan (became effective July 1). The bank also intends to raise its dividend by 7% to $1.50 per share. In March, it increased its quarterly dividend by 12% to $1.40 per share, while in September 2024, it announced a 9% hike in the quarterly dividend to $1.25 per share. In the past five years, the company increased its dividends five times at an annualized growth rate of 7.99%. \r\n\r\nWith robust liquidity, impressive profitability, a strong capital base and reduced SCB, JPMorgan is well-positioned to sustain higher dividends and aggressive share repurchases.\n\nHow is JPM Placed in Terms of Liquidity Compared With Peers?\n\nJPMorgan’s two close peers are Bank of America BAC and Citigroup C.\r\n\r\nLike JPM, Bank of America has a robust liquidity position. As of June 30, 2025, the bank had a total debt of $760.8 billion (the majority of this is long-term in nature). Its cash and cash equivalents were $266 billion on the same date. Hence, the company continues to reward shareholders handsomely. \r\n\r\nFollowing the clearance of the 2025 stress test, Bank of America launched a $40 billion share repurchase plan (became effective Aug. 1) and raised its quarterly dividend by 8% to 28 cents per share. Additionally, it plans to buy back shares worth nearly $4.5 billion every quarter in the near term.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, Citigroup boasts of a solid liquidity position. As of June 30, 2025, its cash and due from banks and total investments aggregated $474.4 billion, while its total debt (short-term and long-term borrowing) was $373.3 billion. This helps the company focus on enhancing capital distribution activities.\r\n\r\nPost-clearing the 2025 Fed stress test, the company hiked its dividend 7% to 60 cents per share. In January, Citigroup's board of directors approved a $20 billion common stock repurchase program with no expiration date. As of June 30, 2025, $16.3 billion worth of authorization remained available.\n\nStory Continues\n\nJPMorgan’s Price Performance, Valuation and Estimates\n\nJPMorgan’s shares have gained 13.9% in the past six months, outperforming the S&P 500 Index’s gain of 10.7%.Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nFrom a valuation standpoint, JPM trades at a 12-month trailing price-to-tangible book (P/TB) of 3.02X, above the industry average.Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for JPMorgan’s 2025 earnings implies a decline of 2.2% on a year-over-year basis, while 2026 earnings are expected to grow at a rate of 5.3%.

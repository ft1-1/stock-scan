            "content": "Key Points\n\nRealty Income is the model of consistency, paying a monthly dividend for 662 consecutive months and raising the payout at least quarterly for 27 years. The real estate investment trust is outperforming the broader market.10 stocks we like better than Realty Income ›\n\nIf you're an income investor, it can be a little overwhelming to choose the best dividend stocks to fill your portfolio. There are so many to choose from -- thousands of stocks and funds from which you can get a quarterly dividend payment. In fact, there are even exchange-traded funds that qualify as dividend ETFs, with dividend reinvestment plans that automatically reinvest the dividend into your account.\n\nThen there are monthly dividend stocks, which pay out more often. I actually prefer these types of dividend stocks because investors get their money quicker than waiting until the end of the quarter, which means that you have more control to reinvest those funds and get the money working for you. And if you are relying on the monthly dividend stock for income, there's nothing more reliable than a monthly payout to help you manage your finances.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now. Continue »\n\nThere are several dozen monthly dividend stocks, but my favorite is the one that's most reliable and provides a great payout -- Realty Income(NYSE: O). And you can take a position in this real estate dividend stock for just $100.\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nA closer look at Realty Income\n\nRealty Income has a mammoth footprint. The company leases more than 15,600 properties around the country, in the U.K., and throughout Europe to more than 1,600 clients. And the company has a diversified, stable income stream -- more than 98% of its portfolio is occupied, and its tenants represent more than 90 industries. That helps guard the company and its investors from industry-specific downturns. SectorPercentage of Total Portfolio Annualized Contractual RentGrocery stores10.7Convenience stores9.8Home improvement6.4Dollar stores6.2Fast-food restaurants4.9Drug stores4.6Automotive service4.3Casual dining restaurants3.8General merchandise3.3\n\nSource: Realty Income. Data as of June 30, 2025\n\nThe company's top clients include 7-Eleven, Dollar General, Walgreens, Dollar Tree, FedEx, Home Depot, and Walmart -- a literal who's who of major retailers that are found in nearly every community.\n\nRealty Income as an investment\n\nRealty Income is a real estate investment trust, which is a type of company created by Congress more than 60 years ago. REITs can focus on a specific segment, such as commercial, residential, retail, or industrial real estate. Some of them even track data center facilities -- which are becoming even more popular through the advent of artificial intelligence and cloud computing -- or the infrastructure that handles energy pipelines, communication towers, and cable networks.\n\nWhat makes REITs most interesting for investors is their unique tax structure. They don't pay federal corporate income tax, so investors don't see the earnings taxed twice (most companies pay tax on their profits, and then the investor pays tax on dividends received). And REITs are required by law to pay out at least 90% of their profits to shareholders, so the dividend is usually above average.\n\nRealty Income's dividend yield is 5.5%, which is a full percentage point higher than the average yield for a real estate stock. And the dividend is remarkably consistent -- this month, Realty Income issued its 662nd consecutive monthly dividend and has increased its dividend every quarter for more than 27 years.\n\nRevenue in the second quarter was $1.41 billion, up from $1.34 billion a year ago, although income fell to $196.9 million and $0.22 per share from $256.6 million and $0.29 per share. The stock is up 10% so far this year (versus the S&P 500's return of 9%), and provides a total return of 12.5% in 2025.\n\nThe bottom line\n\nRealty Income isn't the most glamourous stock out there -- high-powered tech stocks Microsoft and Meta Platforms are also offering a small dividend of less than 1%, and also are involved in building AI applications and data centers that are getting a lot of investor attention these days.\n\nBut I'm not investing for the glamour. I want consistent returns, and I get that with Realty Income. I think it's the best dividend stock you can buy today, and if you invest only $100 per month, you can quickly build an enviable position and start enjoying a monthly return.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Realty Income right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Realty Income, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Realty Income wasn’t one of them.

            "content": "For many investors, Walmart is like an ocean liner. The retail colossus sails along, with stores seemingly everywhere and with infinite capacity to control its destiny despite, well, everything.\n\nThursday, however, Walmart's  (WMT)  second-quarter earnings  missed Wall Street estimates, and the shares slid 4.5% to $97.93.\n\nHelped fuel market slide\n\nThe tumble was felt broadly across the stock market.\n\nWalmart, which has a market capitalization of about $782 billion, was the third-worst performer among the stocks in the Standard & Poor's 500 Index, which fell 0.4% to 6,370.17.\n\nAhead of Walmart were First Solar  (FSLR) , down 7%, and Pacific Gas & Electric  (PCG) , down 4.5%.\n\nRelated: Stock Market Today: Walmart and jobs data disappoints; stocks face declines\n\nWalmart was also the worst performer among the 85 stocks in the S&P 500 Consumer Staples Sector. The sector was off 1.2% to 905.66.\n\nRight behind Walmart in the Staples sector were:\n\nCostco Wholesale  (COST) , down 2.5% to $969.68. Dollar General  (DG) , down 2.1% to $112.49. Target  (TGT)  down 1.7% to $97.06.\n\nAnd Dollar Tree  (DLTR) , down 0.7% at $112.59, was the 12th worst Staples decliner.Shoppers at a Walmart store.Image Source: Jones/Bloomberg via Getty Images\n\nWhat happened?\n\nThe stock market is a bit jittery now. Nine of 11 S&P 500 sectors were lower on the day, with Consumer Staples the weakest of the nine decliners with a 1.2% decline. The S&P 500 itself has fallen 1.7% since peaking at 6,481 on Aug. 16. (The decline isn't big but is visible.)\n\nRelated: OpenAI CEO joins chorus of industry experts warning about an \"AI bubble\"\n\nIt's August, typically a weak month. Plus there's been declines among the biggest or hottest stocks, including Palantir Technologies  (PLTR) , down 17.8% since hitting an all-time high of $190 on Aug. 12. Amazon.com  (AMZN)  and Microsoft  (MSFT)  are off 5.2% and 5.5%, respectively, so far in August.\n\nWalmart's estimate miss was due to surprising issues. Like settling lawsuits, reorganization costs and the like. One-off events, but the some investors may have been annoyed they weren't warned.\n\nMore Retail Stocks:\n\nKroger brings back paper coupons in a new way Target's customers walked away; How it plans to win them back Amazon analysts turn heads with surprising take on grocery plan\n\nEconomic worries. Job growth has slowed. There are conflicting signals about inflation, and Wall Street is uneasy about where Fed is headed next. Supermarket giant Kroger  (KR) , a big Walmart rival, has started to close some 60 stores over the next 18 months.\n\nLeer más\n\nTariff worries. Walmart is a big importer of non-food goods. All of which may be affected by the Trump tariffs at some point. (A saving grace: The tariffs aren't as big as expected so far, and they're coming in gradually.) Overall, Walmart has raised prices maybe 1% since the end of the first quarter.\n\nTo be sure,  Walmart raised its financial guidance and said the “impact of tariffs has been gradual enough that any behavioral adjustments by the customer have been somewhat muted.”\n\nRelated: I went inside the plane running the longest flight in the world\n\nThis story was originally reported by TheStreet on Aug 22, 2025, where it first appeared in the Investing News, Analysis, and Tips section.

Reference actual numbers in your reasoning.\n\n3. **Consistency**: Apply the same scoring standards regardless of the stock. A score of 85 should represent the same quality level across all analyses.\n\n4. **Risk Focus**: Pay special attention to red flags that could invalidate the opportunity (poor liquidity, imminent earnings, deteriorating fundamentals).\n\n5. **Strategy Alignment**: Consider how well this opportunity fits options strategies (directional bias, volatility conditions, time decay considerations).\n\n6. **Completeness Check**: If critical data is missing, note it in your analysis but don't penalize the opportunity excessively for data gaps.\n\nAnalyze the DLTR opportunity now using this framework and respond with the required JSON format.",

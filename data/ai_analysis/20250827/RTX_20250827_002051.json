Cook said she won't step down. Cook's attorney said she would file a lawsuit to challenge what he called an \"illegal action.\"\n\nOn Tuesday, Trump signaled that his administration has \"very good people\" in mind for Cook's position, adding that he expects to soon hold \"a majority\" at the Fed, paving the way to lower rates.\n\nLonger-dated US bond prices fell amid concerns over Trump's moves against Fed independence, as he pushed for interest rate cuts that could stoke inflation. The yield on 10-year (^TNX) Treasurys fell to 4.26%, while longer-term 30-year (^TYX) Treasurys rose to 4.9%. The US dollar (DX=F) index fell.\n\nOn the trade front, Trump vowed to impose fresh tariffs and export curbs on chips and technology from countries that \"unfairly\" placed taxes on US digital services, speaking in a Monday social media post. The reprisal risks escalating trade tensions between the US and the European Union, which defended its use of the measures on Tuesday.\n\nRead more: The latest on Trump's tariffs\n\nMeanwhile, Wall Street is bracing for Nvidia (NVDA) earnings, which land Wednesday after the bell.

Cook has said she will not resign, and her lawyer has signaled a lawsuit over the matter.\n\nWhen asked about a replacement for Cook, Trump stated, “We have some very good people for that position, and I think we have some very good people we’re down to.\"\n\nTrump has been pushing for more control of Federal Reserve policy, hurling social media insults at Fed Chair Jerome Powell for not cutting rates during his term.\n\nStephen Miran was tapped earlier this month to replace Governor Adriana Kugler, who resigned early from her term, which was set to expire on Jan. 31, 2026.

Consumers' assessments of current market conditions and short-term expectations also weakened, with the expectations index falling 1.2 points to 74.8.

Meanwhile, pessimism about future job availability inched up and optimism about future income faded slightly. However, these were partly offset by stronger expectations for future business conditions.” Today at 4:32 PM UTC\n\nBrooke DiPalma\n\nCracker Barrel stock pops after Trump says company should go back to its old logo\n\nCracker Barrel's (CBRL) controversial redesign has made its way to the president's desk.\n\nOn Tuesday, shares of the restaurant operator rose 5% after President Trump called on the company to change its logo back following a redesign it unveiled last week, which sent shares tumbling amid broad customer backlash.\n\n\"Cracker Barrel should go back to the old logo, admit a mistake based on customer response (the ultimate Poll), and manage the company better than ever before,\" Trump said in a post on Truth Social Tuesday morning.\n\n\"They got a Billion Dollars worth of free publicity if they play their cards right.

Cook said she won't step down. Cook's attorney said she would file a lawsuit to challenge what he called an \"illegal action.\"\n\nOn Tuesday, Trump signaled that his administration has \"very good people\" in mind for Cook's position, adding that he expects to soon hold \"a majority\" at the Fed, paving the way to lower rates.\n\nLonger-dated US bond prices fell amid concerns over Trump's moves against Fed independence, as he pushed for interest rate cuts that could stoke inflation. The yield on 10-year (^TNX) Treasurys fell to 4.26%, while longer-term 30-year (^TYX) Treasurys rose to 4.9%. The US dollar (DX=F) index fell.\n\nOn the trade front, Trump vowed to impose fresh tariffs and export curbs on chips and technology from countries that \"unfairly\" placed taxes on US digital services, speaking in a Monday social media post. The reprisal risks escalating trade tensions between the US and the European Union, which defended its use of the measures on Tuesday.\n\nRead more: The latest on Trump's tariffs\n\nMeanwhile, Wall Street is bracing for Nvidia (NVDA) earnings, which land Wednesday after the bell.

Cook has said she will not resign, and her lawyer has signaled a lawsuit over the matter.\n\nWhen asked about a replacement for Cook, Trump stated, “We have some very good people for that position, and I think we have some very good people we’re down to.\"\n\nTrump has been pushing for more control of Federal Reserve policy, hurling social media insults at Fed Chair Jerome Powell for not cutting rates during his term.\n\nStephen Miran was tapped earlier this month to replace Governor Adriana Kugler, who resigned early from her term, which was set to expire on Jan. 31, 2026.

ETH has surged roughly 36% year to-date, while bitcoin is up about 18% during the same period.\n\nCorporate purchases of crypto, along with favorable regulation and increased inflows into spot ETFs, have helped lift prices in recent months.

Consumers' assessments of current market conditions and short-term expectations also weakened, with the expectations index falling 1.2 points to 74.8.

Reference actual numbers in your reasoning.\n\n3. **Consistency**: Apply the same scoring standards regardless of the stock. A score of 85 should represent the same quality level across all analyses.\n\n4. **Risk Focus**: Pay special attention to red flags that could invalidate the opportunity (poor liquidity, imminent earnings, deteriorating fundamentals).\n\n5. **Strategy Alignment**: Consider how well this opportunity fits options strategies (directional bias, volatility conditions, time decay considerations).\n\n6. **Completeness Check**: If critical data is missing, note it in your analysis but don't penalize the opportunity excessively for data gaps.\n\nAnalyze the RTX opportunity now using this framework and respond with the required JSON format.",

up by +0.43%.  September E-mini S&P futures (ESU25) rose +0.43%, and September E-mini Nasdaq futures (NQU25) rose +0.46%.\n\nStock indexes settled higher on Tuesday on some positive US economic news.  The US core capital goods and consumer confidence reports were stronger than expected. Also, the strength in semiconductor makers was supportive of the overall market.  In addition, China is sending Vice Commerce Minister Li Chenggang to the US to meet with US trade officials and negotiators, a move that signals trade talks with China are progressing.Join 200K+ Subscribers: Find out why the midday Barchart Brief newsletter is a must-read for thousands daily.\n\nStock indexes added to their gains Tuesday afternoon when bond yields declined on strong demand for the Treasury's $69 billion auction of 2-year T-notes.  The 10-year T-note yield fell -2 bp to 4.25%.\n\nHowever, fresh concerns over the Fed's independence limited gains in stocks and weighed on the dollar after President Trump moved to fire Fed Governor Lisa Cook, citing \"sufficient cause\" based on the administration’s allegations she made false statements on one or more mortgage loans.  Ms. Cook said she will not resign, and her lawyer pledged to take \"whatever actions are needed to prevent\" the president's \"illegal action.\"\n\nUS July capital goods new orders nondefense ex-aircraft and parts, a proxy for capital spending, rose +1.1% m/m, stronger than expectations of +0.2% m/m.\n\nThe US June S&P Core Logic composite-20 home price index eased to +2.14% y/y from +2.81% y/y in May, the smallest increase in two years.\n\nThe Conference Board US Aug consumer confidence index fell -1.3 to 97.4, stronger than expectations of 96.5.\n\nThe US Aug Richmond Fed manufacturing survey rose +13 to a 5-month high of -7, stronger than expectations of -11.\n\nRegarding tariffs, President Trump late Monday threatened to impose new tariffs and export restrictions on advanced technology and semiconductors in retaliation against other nations' digital services taxes that hit American companies.  Last week, Mr. Trump widened steel and aluminum tariffs to include more than 400 consumer items that contain the metals, such as motorcycles, auto parts, furniture components, and tableware.  The change went into effect last Monday and did not exclude goods already in transit.\n\nIn other recent tariff news, Mr. Trump on August 13 extended the tariff truce with China for another 90 days until November.  On August 6, Mr. Trump announced that he will double tariffs on US imports from India to 50% from the current 25% tariff, due to India's purchases of Russian oil.  According to Bloomberg Economics, the average US tariff will rise to 15.2% if rates are implemented as announced, up from 13.3% earlier, and significantly higher than the 2.3% in 2024 before the tariffs were announced.\n\nOn the geopolitical front, diplomatic efforts to end the war in Ukraine remain elusive, as the US tries to broker a peace deal between the two countries.  On Sunday, Russian Foreign Minister Lavrov said there was no meeting planned between the leaders of Russia and Ukraine and that there \"needs to be an agenda first\" for a meeting to take place.  \"This agenda is not ready at all.\"\n\nThe markets this week will focus on any fresh tariff news or developments on ending the Ukraine-Russian war.  After Wednesday's close, Nvidia will release its quarterly earnings and guidance.  On Thursday, Q2 GDP is expected to be revised upward by +0.1 to 3.1% (q/q annualized). Also, weekly initial unemployment claims are expected to fall by -5,000 to 230,000.  On Friday, July personal spending is expected to climb +0.3% m/m, and July personal income is expected to rise +0.4% m/m.   Also, the July core PCE price index, the Fed's preferred inflation gauge, is expected to climb +0.2% m/m and +2.9% y/y.  In addition, the Aug MNI Chicago PMI is expected to fall -0.6 to 46.5.  Finally, the University of Michigan's final-Aug US consumer sentiment index is expected to be unrevised at 58.6.\n\nFederal funds futures prices are discounting the chances for a -25 bp rate cut at 87% at the next FOMC meeting on September 16-17.  The markets are discounting the chances at 52% for a second -25 bp rate cut at the following meeting on October 28-29.\n\nEarnings reports indicate that S&P 500 earnings for Q2 are on track to rise +9.1% y/y, much better than the pre-season expectations of +2.8% y/y and the most in four years, according to Bloomberg Intelligence.  With Q2 earnings season winding down, over 94% of S&P 500 firms having reported Q2 earnings, about 82% of companies exceeded profit estimates.\n\nOverseas stock markets closed lower on Tuesday.  The Euro Stoxx 50 fell to a 1.5-week low and closed down -1.11%.  China's Shanghai Composite fell from a new 10-year high and closed down -0.39%.  Japan's Nikkei Stock 225 dropped to a 2-week low and closed down -0.97%.\n\nInterest Rates\n\nSeptember 10-year T-notes (ZNU5) on Tuesday closed up +7.5 ticks, and the 10-year T-note yield fell -2.1 bp to 4.254%.\n\nT-notes recovered from early losses on Tuesday and moved higher after strong demand for the Treasury's $69 billion auction of 2-year T-notes sparked short covering in T-note futures.  The auction had a bid-to-cover ratio of 2.69, better than the 10-auction average of 2.62.  T-notes also garnered support when Fed Governor Cook said she has no plans to resign and that \"no cause exists\" for President Trump to fire her.\n\nT-notes initially moved lower on Tuesday after President Trump said he will move to fire Fed Governor Cook, exacerbating investor concerns about the Fed's independence and fanning inflation fears if politics forces interest rates below the neutral rate.  Also, rising inflation expectations undercut T-note prices after the 10-year breakeven inflation expectations rate rose to a 3.5-week high on Tuesday of 2.438%.  In addition, today's stronger-than-expected US core capital goods and consumer confidence reports were bearish for T-notes.\n\nEuropean government bond yields on Tuesday were mixed.  The 10-year German bund yield fell -3.4 bp to 2.723%. 10-year UK gilt yield rose to a 3-month high of 4.765% and finished up +4.7 bp to 4.740%.\n\nThe French Aug consumer confidence indicator unexpectedly fell -1 to a 1.75-year low of 87, weaker than expectations of 89.\n\nSwaps are discounting the chances at 1% for a -25 bp rate cut by the ECB at the September 11 policy meeting.\n\nUS Stock Movers\n\nStrength in semiconductor makers on Tuesday supported gains in the broader market.  Marvell Technology (MRVL) closed up more than +2%.  Also, Nvidia (NVDA), Applied Materials (AMAT), Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), ARM Holdings Plc (ARM), Qualcomm (QCOM), Lam Research (LRCX), and Broadcom (AVGO) closed up more than +1%.\n\nEli Lilly (LLY) closed up more than +5% to lead gainers in the S&P 500 after the company said a second

            "content": "SAN FRANCISCO, Aug.  26, 2025  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- On June 10, 2025, investors in The J.M. Smucker Company (NYSE: SJM) saw the price of their shares decline over 15% after the company announced disappointing Q4 2025 financial results.\n\nThis announcement has prompted national shareholders rights firm Hagens Berman to open an investigation into whether SJM may have violated the securities laws concerning the propriety of its statements about the benefits of the Hostess Brands acquisition. The firm urges SJM investors who suffered substantial losses to submit your losses now. The firm also encourages persons with knowledge who may be able to assist in the investigation to contact its attorneys.\n\nVisit:www.hbsslaw.com/investor-fraud/sjm\r\nContact the Firm Now:SJM@hbsslaw.com\r\n 844-916-0895\n\nThe Hostess Brands Acquisition:\n\nOn November 7, 2023, SJM announced the closing of the transaction to acquire Hostess Brands for about $5.5 billion, $2.4 billion of which was recorded as goodwill in SJM’s Sweet Baked Snacks segment.\n\nThe transaction included the Hostess® sweet baked snacks brands, including Hostess Donettes, Twinkies, CupCakes, DingDongs, Zingers, CoffeeCakes, HoHos, Mini Muffins and Fruit Pies and the Voortman cookie brand, along with manufacturing facilities in Emporia, Kansas; Burlington, Ontario; Chicago, Illinois; Columbus, Georgia; Indianapolis, Indiana and Arkadelphia, Arkansas and a distribution facility in Edgerton, Kansas.\n\nAt the time of closing, SJM assured investors that “the synergy of our businesses creates a compelling platform to drive sustainable growth.” After the acquisition, the Hostess Brands operations have been included in SJM’s Sweet Baked Snacks segment.\n\nSJM Investigation:\n\nOn February 27, 2025, SJM announced dismal Q3 2025 results, including in part a comparable net sales decrease of 8% in Sweet Baked Snacks, a $794 million impairment charge related to the goodwill of the Sweet Baked Snacks segment, a $208 impairment charge to the Hostess Brand trademark, and a $268 million loss on the disposal of the Voortman business.\n\nIn contrast to assurances about synergies driving sustainable growth, the company also said that, as a result of its integration of Hostess, it forecasted declining sales in the Sweet Baked Snacks segment.\n\nDuring the earnings call that day, a JPMorgan analyst noted the charges amounted to about 20% of the Hostess purchase price and questioned management about its comfort with the “general M&A process that Smucker adheres to[.]”\n\nThen, on June 10, 2025, SJM delivered bleak Q4 2025 results, including in part a comparable net sales decrease of 14% in Sweet Baked Snacks, an additional $867 million impairment charge related to the goodwill of the Sweet Baked Snacks segment and an additional $113 million impairment of the Hostess Brand trademark. The impairment charges amounted to an additional 18% of the Hostess acquisition price.\n\nAgain, in contrast to assurances about synergies driving sustainable growth, the company said its updated 2026 financial plan reflects decreased net sales in the Sweet Baked Snacks segment, noting “the sustained underperformance of the sweet baked goods since acquisition, led to a reduction of the forecasted growth rate for the Sweet Baked Snacks reporting unit.”\n\nThis news sent the price of SJM shares down $17.44 (-15%) on June 10, 2025, wiping out about $1.8 billion of shareholder value.\n\n“We’re investigating whether SJM may have slow-rolled the goodwill and trademark write-downs,” said Reed Kathrein, the Hagens Berman partner leading the investigation.\n\nIf you invested in SJM and have substantial losses, or have knowledge that may assist the firm’s investigation, submit your losses now »\n\nIf you’d like more information and answers to frequently asked questions about the SJM investigation, read more »\n\nWhistleblowers: Persons with non-public information regarding SJM should consider their options to help in the investigation or take advantage of the SEC Whistleblower program.

Q2 earnings, about 82% of companies exceeded profit estimates. \n\nOverseas stock markets closed lower on Tuesday.  The Euro Stoxx 50 fell to a 1.5-week low and closed down -1.11%.  China's Shanghai Composite fell from a new 10-year high and closed down -0.39%.  Japan's Nikkei Stock 225 dropped to a 2-week low and closed down -0.97%.\n\nINTEREST RATES\n\nSeptember 10-year T-notes (ZNU5 [https://www.barchart.com/futures/quotes/ZN*0/overview]) on Tuesday closed up +7.5 ticks, and the 10-year T-note yield fell -2.1 bp to 4.254%. \n\nT-notes recovered from early losses on Tuesday and moved higher after strong demand for the Treasury's $69 billion auction of 2-year T-notes sparked short covering in T-note futures.  The auction had a bid-to-cover ratio of 2.69, better than the 10-auction average of 2.62.  T-notes also garnered support when Fed Governor Cook said she has no plans to resign and that \"no cause exists\" for President Trump to fire her. \n\nT-notes initially moved lower on Tuesday after President Trump said he will move to fire Fed Governor Cook, exacerbating investor concerns about the Fed's independence and fanning inflation fears if politics forces interest rates below the neutral rate.  Also, rising inflation expectations undercut T-note prices after the 10-year breakeven inflation expectations rate rose to a 3.5-week high on Tuesday of 2.438%.  In addition, today's stronger-than-expected US core capital goods and consumer confidence reports were bearish for T-notes.\n\nEuropean government bond yields on Tuesday were mixed.  The 10-year German bund yield fell -3.4 bp to 2.723%. 10-year UK gilt yield rose to a 3-month high of 4.765% and finished up +4.7 bp to 4.740%.\n\nThe French Aug consumer confidence indicator unexpectedly fell -1 to a 1.75-year low of 87, weaker than expectations of 89.\n\nSwaps are discounting the chances at 1% for a -25 bp rate cut by the ECB at the September 11 policy meeting.\n\nUS STOCK MOVERS\n\nStrength in semiconductor makers on Tuesday supported gains in the broader market.  Marvell Technology (MRVL [https://www.barchart.com/stocks/quotes/MRVL/overview]) closed up more than +2%.

$20.\n\nKinetik Holdings (KNTK [https://www.barchart.com/stocks/quotes/KNTK/overview]) closed up more than +2% after S&P Dow Jones Indices announced the company will replace Pacific Premier Bancorp in

            "content": "Second quarter earnings season is winding down, and with most of the reports in, the results have been mostly positive.\n\nOver 92% of S&P 500 index companies have reported results, and as of Aug. 18, analysts expected S&P 500 companies to report an 11% jump in earnings per share during the second quarter.\n\nCompanies had lower expectations to clear coming into the quarter — analysts expected S&P 500 earnings to rise 5% in Q2, the slowest pace of earnings growth since Q4 2023 — amid President Trump's tariffs, stocks' lofty valuations, and uncertainty about the health of the US economy.\n\nNvidia (NVDA) results on Wednesday, Aug. 27, highlight this week's earnings\n\nOther companies reporting include PDD Holdings (PDD), Alibaba (BABA), Okta (OKTA), Abercrombie & Fitch (ANF), CrowdStrike (CRWD), Five Below (FIVE), HP (HP), Kohl's (KSS), Snowflake (SNOW), J.M.

Mon, August 25, 2025 at 9:01 PM UTC\n\nGrace O'Donnell\n\nShares of struggling chipmaker Wolfspeed rise as results are better than feared\n\nWolfspeed (WOLF) stock rose just under 1% in after-hours trading following its fiscal fourth quarter results. The struggling chipmaker has been navigating Chapter 11 bankruptcy and is in the midst of a restructuring, after delays in CHIPS Act funding further hampered the company's finances.\n\nWolfspeed reported a loss per share $4.30, compared to a loss of $1.39 per share during the same period a year ago. Revenue came in at $197 million, compared to $201 million the previous year. Wall Street analysts expected worse results.\n\n“Reflecting upon my first three months with Wolfspeed, I am more confident than ever in my decision to join the Company and our opportunity to further strengthen our position in the industry,” Wolfspeed's new CEO, Robert Feurle, said in a statement. “Our next important milestone is for the court to approve our Plan of Reorganization next month, and emerge from Chapter 11 shortly thereafter, with a much stronger financial structure.” Mon, August 25, 2025 at 11:47 AM UTC\n\nGrace O'Donnell\n\nPDD stock jumps after the Temu owner beat earnings estimates\n\nPDD Holdings (PDD) stock gained 7% in premarket trading on Monday after the Chinese e-commerce giant beat earnings estimates by a wide margin.\n\nThe Temu and Pinduoduo owner reported earnings per American depository share (ADS) of 20.75 Chinese yuan (approximately $2.89) compared to estimates of 12.30 yuan ($1.72), per S&P Global Market Intelligence estimates.\n\nRevenue rose 7% year over year to 10.4 billion ($1.45 billion), barely beating estimates as price competition with rivals Alibaba (BABA) and JD.com (JD) and higher costs from tariffs weighed on margins.\n\n“Revenues growth further moderated this quarter amid intense competition,” said Jun Liu, PDD Holdings vice president of finance. \"As we remain focused on long-term value creation, the sustained investments may continue to weigh on short-term profitability.”\n\nRead more here from Reuters Fri, August 22, 2025 at 8:51 PM UTC\n\nGrace O'Donnell\n\nNvidia to highlight next week's earnings\n\nSecond quarter results from Abercrombie & Fitch (ANF), Kohl's (KSS), and Best Buy (BBY) next week will continue to beat the drum of retail earnings after reports from America's big box stores, Walmart (WMT) and Target (TGT).\n\nBut it's Nvidia's (NVDA) earnings that will be the star attraction, as the AI chipmaker's stock has an 8% weighting in the S&P 500 (^GSPC).\n\nAs Yahoo Finance Senior Tech Editor Dan Howley writes, investors will be squarely focused on Nvidia's data center business — even more so since the company announced a new gigascale networking plan that will combine the performance of multiple data centers to create one massive GPU. And many will be eager to hear more about a new China chip Nvidia is developing with the Trump administration.\n\nHere's a look at next week's earnings calendar, marking a sort of grand finale for the second quarter reporting season:\n\nMonday: PDD Holdings (PDD)\n\nTuesday: BMO (BMO), MongoDB (MDB), Okta (OKTA), PVH (PVH)\n\nWednesday: Nvidia (NVDA), Abercrombie & Fitch, CrowdStrike (CRWD), Five Below (FIVE), HP (HP), Kohl's, Pure Storage (PSTG), Snowflake (SNOW), The J.M.

That represents 66% annual earnings growth.\n\nThe company's founder and CEO, Eric Yuan, noted that the strong quarter comes as artificial intelligence reshapes the way people are working. The company highlighted its paid add-on for custom AI agents that help with meeting prep and call summaries as drivers.\n\nRevenue rose 5% to $1.2 billion, bolstered by 7% growth in Enterprise revenue. The company's monthly churn rate remained flat year over year at 2.9%.\n\nZoom also raised its full-year revenue outlook and free cash flow guidance, which is now expected to be in the range of $1.74 billion to $1.78 billion.\n\nFor the full 2026 fiscal year, total revenue is expected to be between $4.825 billion and $4.835 billion while diluted EPS is expected to be between $5.81 and $5.84.

Wall Street analysts were expecting earnings per share of $3.64 on revenue of $2.85 billion.\n\nAfter a sluggish spring season in the housing market, there have been signs of a resurgence, with housing starts jumping in July.

Analysts had expected orders growth.\n\n\"The average sales price of new contracts was $1.0 million, up 4.5% year-over-year,\" CEO Douglas Yearley said in the earnings release. \"Contract dollars were flat despite a 4% decline in units.

Sales in the furniture retailer's wholesale segment increased 1%, and retail sales rose 5%, but they were offset by weakness in the Joybird brand, which saw sales decline 14%.\n\nLa-Z-Boy reported diluted earnings per share of $0.44, compared to $0.61 per share a year ago. The Street was looking for earnings of $0.52 per share.\n\nLa-Z-Boy's guidance also came in lighter than expected.

Reference actual numbers in your reasoning.\n\n3. **Consistency**: Apply the same scoring standards regardless of the stock. A score of 85 should represent the same quality level across all analyses.\n\n4. **Risk Focus**: Pay special attention to red flags that could invalidate the opportunity (poor liquidity, imminent earnings, deteriorating fundamentals).\n\n5. **Strategy Alignment**: Consider how well this opportunity fits options strategies (directional bias, volatility conditions, time decay considerations).\n\n6. **Completeness Check**: If critical data is missing, note it in your analysis but don't penalize the opportunity excessively for data gaps.\n\nAnalyze the SJM opportunity now using this framework and respond with the required JSON format.",

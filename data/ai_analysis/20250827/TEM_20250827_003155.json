            "title": "Tempus' Key Acquisitions Strengthen Its AI Healthcare Leadership",
            "content": "Last Friday, Tempus AI, Inc. TEM announced the acquisition of Paige, an AI company specializing in digital pathology. The acquisition, valued at $81.25 million, is expected to allow Tempus to grow its dataset and expand its experienced technical team. Paige brings nearly 7 million digitized pathology slide images and associated clinical and molecular data that are carefully labeled. Paige has already created the first AI tool cleared by the FDA for pathology. These factors will help Tempus establish a strong footprint in digital pathology with an industry-leading technology portfolio.\n\nAdditionally, in March, Tempus acquired Deep 6 AI, a leading AI-powered precision research platform for healthcare organizations and life sciences companies. Deep 6 AI works with over 750 healthcare providers and has access to medical records from more than 30 million patients. By integrating Deep 6 AI’s technology, Tempus significantly expanded its reach and enhanced platforms such as Next, which improves patient care, and TIME, which connects patients to life-saving clinical trials.\n\nFurthermore, earlier this year, Tempus completed the acquisition of Ambry Genetics, a genetic testing company that specializes in hereditary cancer screening and other genetic diseases. Tempus acquired Ambry Genetics with $375 million in cash and $225 million in stock, with $100 million of that stock temporarily locked up for a year. By combining Ambry’s genetic testing strengths with Tempus’ AI and data tools, the latter broadened its healthcare offerings into new areas, like pediatrics, women's health, rare disease, immunology and cardiology.\n\nAcquisitions by TEM’s Peers\n\nIn April, NeoGenomics, Inc. NEO completed its previously announced acquisition of Pathline, LLC, a CLIA/CAP/NYS-certified laboratory based in New Jersey. This strengthens NeoGenomics' footprint in the Northeastern United States, expanding its molecular and hematology-oncology testing services. It is expected to drive top-line growth and generate cost synergies, with a positive impact on adjusted EBITDA by 2026.\n\nIn 2024, Veracyte, Inc. VCYT acquired C2i Genomics, Inc. for $70 million in shares, with up to $25 million more, contingent on performance milestones, over two years. The acquisition brought AI-driven, whole-genome minimal residual disease (MRD) capabilities to Veracyte’s novel diagnostics platforms, enabling test expansion from early diagnosis to treatment monitoring and recurrence detection.\n\nTEM Stock Outperforms Industry & Benchmark\n\nYear to date, Tempus AI shares have surged 121.3%, outperforming the industry’s 27% growth and the S&P 500 composite’s 9.8% improvement.\n\nStory Continues\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nExpensive Valuation\n\nTEM currently trades at a forward 12-month Price-to-Sales (P/S) of 9.04X compared with the industry average of 5.90X.Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nTEM Stock Estimate Trend\n\nIn the past 30 days, Tempus AI's loss per share estimate for 2025 has moved south 3%.

            "title": "Should Investors Rethink Tempus AI After Shares Double and New Novartis Collaboration?",
            "content": "Thinking about what to do with Tempus AI shares right now? You are not alone. The stock has been full of surprises for investors looking for the next standout opportunity. After sprinting more than 120% year-to-date, Tempus AI has cemented itself as one of the boldest growth stories out there. But if you just look back one week, you will see a pullback of about 3.3%. Is this a natural breather after that meteoric rise, or a sign that risk is creeping in?\n\nTo put those moves in perspective, Tempus AI has notched an impressive 17.7% jump over the past month, and the 1-year gain stands at 25.4%. Some of this has been fueled by excitement around recent collaborations in the healthcare AI space and broader optimism about the role of technology in medical diagnostics. That hype has brought more eyeballs and more volatility, as traders and long-term investors debate whether Tempus AI is already priced for perfection.\n\nHere is where things get interesting. When you run Tempus AI through six traditional valuation checks, the stock scores a 0 out of 6 for being undervalued. In other words, as of now, it is not hitting any of the classic metrics that signal a bargain buy.\n\nBefore you draw conclusions, let’s dig into these valuation methods and see what they actually reveal. And stick around, because at the end, I will share a perspective on valuation you may not have considered but can be even more powerful than the numbers alone.\n\nTempus AI scores just 0/6 on our valuation checks. See what other red flags we found in the full valuation breakdown.\n\nApproach 1: Tempus AI Cash Flows\n\nA Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model takes a company’s future expected cash flows and discounts them back to today’s dollars to estimate what the business is really worth. For Tempus AI, this model begins with a current free cash flow of -$90 million, reflecting negative cash outflows as the company invests heavily in growth. Looking ahead, analysts project a remarkable transformation to positive cash flows, reaching $163 million by 2028 and continuing to climb according to long-term estimates.\n\nSimply Wall St’s DCF model blends analyst predictions for the first five years and extrapolates the next five, then calculates an estimated intrinsic value of $17.09 per share. Comparing this to the actual share price, the DCF model suggests Tempus AI appears 344.1% overvalued. In simple terms, the stock currently trades well above what its discounted future cash flows would justify.\n\nResult: OVERVALUED\n\nHead to the Valuation section of our Company Report for more details on how we arrive at this Fair Value for Tempus AI.\n\nStory Continues\n\nTEM Discounted Cash Flow as at Aug 2025\n\nOur DCF analysis suggests Tempus AI may be overvalued by 344.1%. Find undervalued stocks based on DCF analysis or create your own screener to find better value opportunities.\n\nApproach 2: Tempus AI Price vs Sales\n\nFor companies like Tempus AI that are still building their profitability, the price-to-sales (P/S) ratio becomes a key valuation tool. This metric is especially useful for high-growth firms without positive earnings, offering investors a way to gauge market expectations relative to current revenues. Typically, higher P/S ratios may be justified if investors anticipate rapid future growth, while higher risk or stagnant sales may lead to lower figures.\n\nTempus AI currently trades at a P/S multiple of 13.85x, which stands out in comparison to the life sciences industry average of just 3.45x. Even among peer companies, the average is much lower at 4.28x. This indicates that the market is placing a significant premium on Tempus’s potential, reflecting strong optimism about future expansion that may be influenced by the company's innovative advances and aggressive growth strategy.\n\nTo provide a more tailored sense of value, Simply Wall St uses what is called a Fair Ratio. This proprietary benchmark factors in Tempus AI’s growth prospects, risks, profit margins, industry sector, and overall market capitalization. The Fair Ratio for Tempus AI is 9.39x. This approach is more nuanced than a simple peer or sector average because it accounts for the company’s unique strengths and potential headwinds.\n\nWhen comparing Tempus AI’s actual P/S of 13.85x to its Fair Ratio of 9.39x, the current valuation appears stretched. The stock trades well above what is justified based on its overall risk and growth profile, suggesting that the shares may be priced with a considerable amount of optimism already included.\n\nResult: OVERVALUEDNasdaqGS:TEM PS Ratio as at Aug 2025\n\nPS ratios tell one story, but what if the real opportunity lies elsewhere? Discover companies where insiders are betting big on explosive growth.\n\nUpgrade Your Decision Making: Choose your Tempus AI Narrative\n\nEarlier, we mentioned that there is an even better way to understand valuation. Let us introduce you to Narratives. A Narrative is simply your story—your perspective and unique belief about a company—that underpins the numbers you use for fair value, future revenue, earnings, and margins. Narratives bridge the gap between the company’s potential and your personal forecast, connecting what you believe about the business to actual financial outcomes and fair value estimates.\n\nOn Simply Wall St’s Community page, millions of investors use Narratives as a straightforward and accessible tool to decide when a stock looks attractive or overpriced by comparing their calculated Fair Value with the real market price. The true power of Narratives is that they update automatically whenever new announcements, earnings releases, or news are published. This means your investment view can evolve as fresh information becomes available.\n\nFor example, one Tempus AI Narrative projects a fair value of $75, while another sees it at $60. This demonstrates how two investors, working from the same kind of data, can arrive at very different conclusions. Narratives empower you to invest with conviction based on your own interpretation of both the story and the numbers.\n\nDo you think there's more to the story for Tempus AI?

            "title": "Tempus AI or Butterfly: Which AI Health Tech Stock is a Buy Now?",
            "content": "Tempus AI TEM and Butterfly Network BFLY both just reported their respective second-quarter 2025 results, which shed light on their AI-driven trajectories. Tempus AI continues to post rapid top-line expansion while leveraging its growing data ecosystem and clinical partnerships to reach closer to profitability. Butterfly Network, meanwhile, reported modest revenue growth as it works to scale adoption of its AI-driven handheld ultrasound platform and drive operating discipline. For investors, the choice is between Tempus’ high-growth precision medicine model and Butterfly’s turnaround-stage imaging platform.\n\nLet's Delve Deeper:\n\nOver the past 30 days, shares of Tempus AI have surged 29.9% while Butterfly Network stock has declined 21.6%. Butterfly’s moderate top-line gains, continued cash burn and reliance on cost-cutting over meaningful revenue acceleration dampened investor confidence. Meanwhile, the broader Medical Info Systems industry hasgained 2.7% and the S&P 500 index has risen 1.5% during this period.\n\nOne-Month Share Price PerformanceZacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nKey Growth Factors for Tempus AI\n\nBuilding a Wide Moat, Profitability Within Reach: Tempus AI posted a strong second quarter of 2025, with revenues rising nearly 90% year over year, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 5.12%, led by a 115% surge in Genomics from accelerating oncology and hereditary testing volumes and a 35.7% increase in high-margin Data and Services from AI-enabled data licensing. Gross profit jumped 158%, lifting adjusted gross margin to 62% despite a 32.2% rise in the cost of revenues (genomics, data and services). This breadth highlights how Tempus AI is building a wide moat across both clinical diagnostics and data-driven insights.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA loss narrowed to just $5.6 million. Management’s raised guidance for $1.26 billion in 2025 revenues and $5 million adjusted EBITDA underscores a disciplined shift toward sustainable growth.\n\nInnovation and Data Scale: Innovation is strengthening Tempus’ AI’s competitive moat, highlighted by the launch of the xM liquid biopsy, Ambry’s expanding role as a standard in hereditary testing and the growing integration of AI tools like Tempus Next and Tempus One into routine clinical practice. Alongside these advancements, Tempus’ scale in data and AI is becoming a structural advantage, with more than 40 million patient records connected and advanced foundation models now being trained on NVIDIA’s NVDA latest hardware. Strategic partnerships, such as the AstraZeneca AZN /Pathos AI collaboration, further demonstrate how Tempus AI’s data assets and AI capabilities combinedly is becoming essential to the pharmaceutical industry.\n\nStory Continues\n\nDownsides Prevail\n\nTempus AI is still operating at a loss, with negative adjusted EBITDA in the second quarter of 2025. Costs are also climbing, with the cost of revenues rising 32.2% year over year, reflecting the heavy investments required to scale both genomics and data services. This reliance on continued expansion to offset expenses leaves Tempus vulnerable if testing volumes or data licensing growth were to slow.\n\nKey Growth Factors for Butterfly Network\n\nEnterprise Momentum: Butterfly is gaining traction with large-scale deployments, including closing an enterprise-wide deal with one of the world’s top five health systems. This validates the scalability of its iQ3 handheld ultrasound and demonstrates confidence among major providers in Butterfly’s platform. Although sales cycles remain elongated, these large-scale wins create a foundation for repeatable, high-value contracts. At the same time, Compass AI, launching in the third quarter, signals Butterfly Network’s shift from hardware-led growth to a recurring, software-driven model. With features like voice automation and scan quality feedback, it is designed to boost productivity, positioning Butterfly to capture higher-margin, recurring revenue growth.\n\nExpanding Horizons With HomeCare, Octiv, and Butterfly Garden: Butterfly’s HomeCare pilots have reduced heart failure readmissions, with a state-level rollout due in 2025 and nationwide expansion that could generate $40-$60 million annually from one customer. Octiv, its semiconductor and imaging platform, is attracting partners, including a generative AI company, creating new licensing opportunities. At the same time, Butterfly Garden is becoming a differentiator with new partners, three FDA-cleared AI apps, the upcoming HeartFocus launch, and collaborations like MSK VUE and ScanLab. Together, these initiatives extend ultrasound’s reach, drive integration in healthcare, and enhance customer stickiness.\n\nRisks Remain\n\nDespite clear progress, Butterfly Network continues to face challenges that may temper near-term momentum. Sales cycles remain elongated, which could delay the conversion of enterprise wins into meaningful revenue. The HomeCare opportunity, while promising, is still in early pilot and rollout stages. Similarly, Octiv and Butterfly Garden are in formative phases, reliant on partner uptake, regulatory progress, and execution to deliver meaningful returns.\n\nComparing Valuation: BFLY is Attractively Valued Than TEM\n\nTempus AI is trading at a forward 12-month price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 9.59, above its median of 8.05 over the last year. Butterfly Network’s forward sales multiple sits at 3.73, below its last one-year median of 5.46. Meanwhile, TEM appears expensive when compared with the industry average of 6X. On the other hand, BFLY stays slightly discounted compared to the industry.Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nAverage Target Price for BFLY Suggests a Better Upside\n\nBased on short-term price targets offered by 10 analysts, TEM’s average price target represents a decline of 8.1% from the last closing price of $76.71.Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nBased on short-term price targets offered by three analysts, BFLY’s average price target represents an increase of 128% from the last closing price of $1.39.Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nBuy BFLY Right Now, Wait for TEM\n\nIn summary, while Tempus AI continues to deliver impressive growth, margin expansion and product innovation, its premium valuation, ongoing losses, and rising costs justify a more cautious stance, aligning with its Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Investors may want to wait for a more attractive entry point or clearer path to sustained profitability before adding exposure. By contrast, Butterfly Network — despite modest top-line progress and lingering execution risks — now trades at distressed levels with analyst targets implying significant upside potential. With a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), the stock appears more compelling in the near term, offering investors a chance to capitalize on a turnaround story.

Sometimes research that changes the investing world can come from the halls of academia. Partha Mohanram is a great example of this. While academic research has shown that value investing works over time, it has found the opposite for growth investing. Mohanram turned that research on its head by developing a growth model that produced significant market outperformance. His research paper \"Separating Winners from Losers among Low Book-to-Market Stocks using Financial Statement Analysis\" looked at the criteria that can be used to separate growth stocks that continue their upward trajectory from those that don't. Mohanram is currently the John H. Watson Chair in Value Investing at the University of Toronto and was previously an Associate Professor at the Columbia Business School.\n\nAdditional Research Links\n\nTop Healthcare Stocks\n\nDividend Aristocrats 2025\n\nWide Moat Stocks\n\nRecession Proof Stocks\n\nHigh Insider Ownership Stocks\n\nFactor-Based Stock Portfolios\n\nAbout Validea: Validea is aninvestment researchservice that follows the published strategies of investment legends.

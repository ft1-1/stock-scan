            "title": "Toast vs. Block: Which POS Platform Stock Offers More Upside?",
            "content": "Toast Inc. TOST and Block Inc. XYZ are leading players in the merchant payments and point-of-sale (POS) space. TOST provides software-as-a-service (SaaS) and hardware solutions focused on the restaurant market. On the other hand, Block is a diversified fintech company, and its Square for Restaurants POS platform competes directly with TOST’s offerings.\n\nBoth firms are tapping into the ongoing digitization of payments and the rise of integrated software platforms for small businesses to gain a larger share of the profitable POS market, which is expected to witness a CAGR of 8.1% between 2025 and 2030 and reach $181.47 billion, per a Grand View Research report.\n\nLet’s deep dive and find out which POS stock offers greater upside in this fast-growing market.\n\nToast: Restaurant Focused Disruptor\n\nEfforts to expand its presence in the core U.S. SMB restaurant market, as well as drive growth across three new growth areas: enterprise, international, and food & beverage retail markets, look promising. TOST added a record 8,500 net new locations, ending the second quarter with 148,000 total locations, a 24% increase year over year. Toast continues to increase market share in nearly every SMB market it serves, even in large and small metro areas where penetration exceeds 30%, highlighting that its local go-to-market strategy is working. Management expects net additions in 2025 to surpass those in 2024.\n\nToast exceeded 10,000 live locations across enterprise, international, and food & beverage retail segments in the second quarter and is on track to top $100 million in ARR by 2025-end. Wins such as Firehouse Subs highlight traction among large QSR brands. This will boost upselling and platform expansion. It also ventured into Australia, its fourth international market after the U.K., Ireland and Canada.\n\nToast’s AI-powered tools are positioning it to stay ahead of the curve in restaurant technology. It launched Toast Go 3 Handheld, which uses ToastIQ with built-in cellular connectivity, thereby making it simpler for restaurant staff to take orders, process payments and print receipts effortlessly across cellular and Wi-Fi networks. It is lighter and now has a 24-hour battery life. ToastIQ is an AI-powered intelligence engine that combines restaurant expertise, data and AI to enhance its platform.\n\nDriven by strong results and continued momentum, TOST now expects 29% growth (earlier guided to 26%) in fintech and subscription gross profit for 2025 at the midpoint, while adjusted EBITDA is now estimated at $575 million ($550 million was the previous projection), with a 32% margin, an increase of five percentage points from 2024.\n\nStory Continues\n\nNonetheless, heightened uncertainty prevailing over the macro environment amid escalating trade war, with tariff troubles raising fears of increased costs and dampening of consumer purchasing power, remains a concern. Decline in Gross Payment Volume or GPV per location is another headwind, as it implies lower average transaction volumes. TOST’s overall GPV surged 23% year over year to $50 billion in the second quarter, but GPV per location declined 1% year over year.\n\nBlock: Diversified Fintech With Rising POS Momentum\n\nBlock’s two growth drivers, Square and Cash App, are powering its fintech ecosystem. Square’s POS serves a wide variety of businesses — retailers, service providers and restaurants — giving it a broad customer base that helps reduce risk tied to any single industry. It remains focused on new product launches to drive revenues for Square.\n\nXYZ recently launched Square AI, which uses an AI agent, codenamed goose and is powered by Square data. It is designed to give sellers quick, data-driven insights into their businesses. Integrated directly into the Square Dashboard, it allows sellers to work smarter and faster by using a conversational interface to uncover sales trends, identify top-selling items by time of day, analyze customer spending behaviors and more. This feature highlights Block’s efforts to bring advanced AI capabilities to its sellers. In May, TOST launched Square Handheld in the United States and is now introducing it in international territories.\n\nIn the last reported quarter, the Square ecosystem accounted for $1.76 billion in transaction revenues, up 8.8% year over year. Square GPV growth accelerated to 10% while gross profit was up 11%, which included the benefit of a previously disclosed network remediation payment. Food and beverage businesses saw particularly strong momentum with GPV up 15%, and retail followed with a 10% increase. International GPV was up 25% year-over-year growth, driven by stronger sales and partnerships.\n\nManagement highlighted that Square is now sharply focused on expanding in the QSR segment. Square is also benefiting from a renewed go-to-market strategy, with investments across marketing, field sales, and partnerships. The company’s field sales performance was especially strong in the second quarter, delivering its highest-ever level of new volume added, and marking its best growth in new volume since the third quarter of 2021. XYZ highlighted that the forecasted gross profit added from new clients exceeded the forecasted GPV added on a year-to-date basis, which signals healthy pricing and product attach rates.\n\nManagement guided for low double-digit GPV growth for Square in both the third and fourth quarters, representing a modest acceleration from the 10% growth witnessed in the second quarter. However, gross profit growth for the third quarter is expected to be in the high single-digit range, affected by two near-term headwinds. First, the company made the decision to increase operational flexibility at a key processing partner, which will raise processing costs. Second, it is continuing to invest in hardware as an effective go-to-market tool.\n\nTOST vs XYZ Stock Performance\n\nTOST and XYZ have declined 11.2% and 1.8%, respectively, over the past month.Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nValuation for TOST & XYZ\n\nBoth TOST and Block are overvalued, as suggested by the Value Score of F and D, respectively.Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nIn terms of twelve-month forward price/earnings, TOST shares are trading at 37.99X, higher than XYZ’s 24.17X.\n\nHow Do Zacks Estimates Compare for TOST & XYZ?\n\nAnalysts have revised their earnings estimates upward by 12.8% for TOST’s bottom line for the current year.Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nFor XYZ, analysts have revised estimates by 3.6% upward for the current year.Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nTOST or XYZ: Which is a Better Pick?\n\nTOST and XYZ currently carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) each.

            "title": "Better Fintech Stock: Block vs. PayPal",
            "content": "Key Points\n\nBlock is putting up double-digit gross profit growth, but Bitcoin could drive results in the future. PayPal's stock has taken a beating, but the business still rakes in plenty of free cash flow. Investors should decide which stock to buy based on their risk tolerance. 10 stocks we like better than PayPal ›\n\nIt's been a disappointing year for these two companies. As of Aug. 21, Block (NYSE: XYZ) shares have tanked 13% in 2025. PayPal (NASDAQ: PYPL) has fared worse, with its shares down 21% this year. If that weren't bad enough, both are trading more than 70% below their all-time highs, a gut-wrenching reality that might scare most investors away.\n\nBut to be clear, both companies have positive attributes. Between Block and PayPal, which is the better fintech stock to buy? Image source: Getty Images.\n\nBlock's two ecosystems continue to grow\n\nBlock operates two successful ecosystems that can be viewed as separate businesses. Square posted 11% gross profit growth last quarter (Q2 2025, ended June 30), offering tools and services to merchants. Cash App, which serves individuals, is growing at a faster clip. And it has 57 million monthly active users.\n\nThe business continues to innovate to drive further growth. For instance, Square AI gives merchants access to valuable data insights. And Cash App Borrow, a short-term lending product, saw originations rise 95% year over year. Block's expansion playbook is focused on introducing new products and services to bring more merchants and consumers into the fold. Then it's about boosting use and monetization.\n\nLooking ahead, it's clear that Bitcoin will slowly become a bigger factor in Block's success. Founder and CEO Jack Dorsey is very bullish on this crypto. And he has overseen new projects, like the development of a hardware wallet and mining equipment, to further accelerate Bitcoin's adoption. Should the digital asset continue on its impressive trajectory, this could be a boon for Block over the long term.\n\nPayPal has long been a leader in digital payments\n\nPayPal has a presence in more than 200 countries across the globe. It handled $443 billion in total payment volume in the second quarter (ended June 30). And it counts 438 million active users. This scale demonstrates just how important PayPal is in the world of online commerce. And with its two-sided platform, PayPal benefits from a network effect.\n\nBut the company has dealt with slower growth in recent years, which prompted a leadership change. Alex Chriss, who has been CEO since September 2023, is doing a good job so far of righting the ship. He has brought innovation back to the forefront.\n\nStory Continues\n\nFor instance, a key recent initiative is PayPal World. Set to launch later this year, it's a global platform that will connect different digital wallets and payment systems. This could provide a more seamless experience. PayPal also has its own stablecoin, called PYUSD, to lower costs and speed up transactions.\n\nUnder Chriss, PayPal is also better monetizing its Venmo segment, which essentially competes directly with Block's Cash App. Venmo is trying to become more than a peer-to-peer payment service, for example, with its very popular debit card. Venmo posted greater-than-20% revenue growth in Q2, better than that of the company overall.\n\nDespite the stock's performance, PayPal operates from a position of financial strength. Earnings per share calculated according to generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) soared 20% in Q2. Free cash flow is expected to be $6 billion to $7 billion for the full year.\n\nThe final verdict\n\nThere's no denying that both of these companies have established themselves as powerful forces in the fintech industry. Block operates with a bigger presence in physical commerce, while PayPal leads in online payments. Nonetheless, both of these businesses face a lot of competition.\n\nInvestors who have a higher risk tolerance might want to consider Block. The company's focus on Bitcoin activities adds upside, but it also introduces uncertainty, as ultimate success isn't guaranteed. On the other hand, investors who want to own a financially sound digital payments powerhouse will favor PayPal. The company's much cheaper forward price-to-earnings ratio of 12.9 is also hard to overlook.\n\nAnd, of course, those who want more exposure to the fintech space could choose to own both of these stocks.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in PayPal right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in PayPal, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and PayPal wasn’t one of them.

The company is winning new customers as well as repeat customers, reflecting a strong adoption rate as well as growing credibility and reputation. Strong backlog is expected to drive top-line and bottom-line results, driving shares that have dropped 19.5% in the past month. \r\n\r\nRF Industries expects third-quarter fiscal 2025 sales to be roughly in line with second-quarter sales ($18.9 million) and a significant increase from $16.8 million reported in the year-ago quarter.

            "content": "Amphenol Corp. (NYSE:APH [https://www.chartmill.com/stock/quote/APH]) has appeared as a noteworthy candidate for investors using a high growth momentum plan merged with technical breakout formations. This plan focuses on companies showing solid earnings acceleration, powerful sales growth, and favorable analyst changes, key parts of the ChartMill High Growth Momentum Rating, while also displaying good technical condition and consolidation formations that indicate possible breakout chances. By selecting for stocks with a High Growth Momentum Rating above 4, a Technical Rating above 7, and a Setup Rating above 7, this process seeks to find equities that are not only increasing quickly but are also set for short-term price gains based on chart formations and market momentum.\n\nThe company’s fundamental growth picture is especially notable. Amphenol has reported outstanding quarterly earnings per share (EPS) growth, with the newest quarter rising 84.09% year-over-year, after earlier quarters showing gains of 57.5%, 34.15%, and 28.21%. This quickening in profitability is backed by notable revenue growth, including a 56.53% increase in sales for the most recent quarter and a trailing twelve-month revenue growth of 40.51%. Such numbers are vital to the High Growth Momentum Rating, as they show not only present results but also favorable momentum that could persist. Also, the company has exceeded EPS predictions in each of the past four quarters by an average of over 15%, while also beating revenue forecasts regularly. Analyst outlook has further supported this view, with rises to next-year EPS predictions by 14.4% over the past three months, signaling increasing belief in Amphenol’s future earnings capacity.\n\nFrom a technical viewpoint, Amphenol shows excellent strength. The stock has a perfect Technical Rating of 10, showing its powerful upward trends across various timeframes. It is trading close to its 52-week high, doing better than 90% of all stocks in the market over the past year, and displays favorable trends in both short-term and long-term moving averages. The Setup Rating of 8 points out a consolidation formation that has lately developed, marked by lower volatility and a retreat that could present a good entry chance. According to the technical report [https://www.chartmill.com/stock/quote/APH/technical-analysis], the stock is now showing a bull flag formation, which frequently comes before more upward movement. Resistance is found just above the present price, around $109.98 to $111.85, with support located near $108.65 to $109.73, giving a clear structure for possible trade management.\n\nThis mix of strong fundamental momentum and good technical placement makes Amphenol a notable candidate for investors looking for high-growth chances with specific risk limits. The combination of quickening earnings, growing profit margins, favorable estimate changes, and a helpful chart formation emphasizes the stock’s attraction within a structured growth and momentum plan.\n\nFor those wanting to investigate comparable high-growth, technically set stocks, more screening outcomes are available through this link [https://www.chartmill.com/stock/stock-screener?sid=719&f=v1_50b500,atrpct_a_1,sl_ta_7_X,sl_se_7_X,p_pg20,exch_us,sl_ratingHgm_6_X&s=se&v=3].\n\n_Disclaimer: This article is for informational purposes only and does not constitute investment advice.

Amphenol plans to acquire Trexon, a privately-held company specializing in high-reliability interconnect and cable assemblies for the defense market, for $1 billion in cash. The deal is expected to close in Q4 2025 and is projected to add about 1.3% to Amphenol’s sales and earnings per share within two years.Truist Reaffirms Buy Rating on Amphenol (APH), Keeps $126 PT\n\nAndor Bujdoso/Shutterstock.com\n\nTruist Securities views the Trexon acquisition as a positive move, stating that acquisitions are Amphenol’s “highest-return use of cash.” They highlighted the deal as a factor supporting their “constructive outlook” on the stock.

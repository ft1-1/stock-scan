The deal is expected to improve CrowdStrike's Falcon Next-Gen SIEM, which lays the groundwork for agentic security and IT operations.\n\nFor the quarter ended July 31, the cybersecurity firm reported adjusted earnings per share of $0.93, which was more than the consensus estimate of $0.83. Revenue totaled $1.17B, which also surpassed the estimate of $1.15B.\n\nThe security company also increased its annual recurring revenue by 20% year over year to $4.66B.\n\nFor the quarter in progress, CrowdStrike projects adjusted EPS to range from $0.93 to $0.95, which is more than the $0.91 estimate. However, it expects revenue to range from $1.21B to $1.22B, which is short of the $1.23B estimate.\n\nFor the full fiscal year, CrowdStrike increased its adjusted EPS and revenue outlook. It now expects EPS to range from $3.60 to $3.72, with a midpoint of $3.66 more than the $3.51 estimate. The previous midpoint expected was $3.50.\n\nFull-year revenue is now expected to range from $4.75B to $4.81B, with the $4.78B midpoint matching the estimate. Its prior midpoint was $4.77B.\n\n“With reacceleration a quarter ahead of our expectations, CrowdStrike delivered an exceptional Q2. Record Q2 net new ARR of $221 million, over 1,000 Flex customers, and more than 100 re-flexes highlight CrowdStrike as the leader in cybersecurity consolidation,” said CrowdStrike CEO and founder George Kurtz.\n\nMORE ON CROWDSTRIKE\n\n \t* CrowdStrike: Down 20% In 2 Months, Is It A Buy Ahead Of Earnings?

As of today's call, it has doubled to 28%. This includes the additional 30% China tariffs, 50% India tariff, 20% via non-tariff and averaged 18% tariff on the rest of the world as well as the 50% steel and aluminum tariffs and a 50% copper tariff.\"\n\nThe furniture company, which houses brands such as West Elm and Pottery Barn, reported better-than-expected earnings of $2.00 per share. Wall Street expected EPS of $1.80.\n\nWilliams-Sonoma stock was down 1.4% in early afternoon trading. The stock sank earlier this week, along with other furniture stocks, after President Trump posted on social media that his administration would open an investigation into furniture imports and impose additional tariffs on the sector.\n\n\"It's early to speculate — I think we're day 5 of a 50-day probe, there's not a lot of information on this subject,\" Laura Alber, Williams-Sonoma's CEO, said about possible furniture tariffs. \"But I will say that it's going to be very difficult for the industry, even if tariffs are put on to bring a huge amount back to the United States in a short window of time, because there aren't the factories available to do a lot of production.\"\n\n\"For us, of course, we will be in a much better position than most if that were to happen because of our strong USA manufacturing capabilities already,\" Alber continued. \"We have ... [a] good chunk of our upholstery in the United States as we speak, and we can do more there, and that would be something we'd really push.\" Today at 1:32 PM UTC\n\nGrace O'Donnell\n\nRoyal Bank of Canada reports Q3 profit rose to $5.4 billion, revenue also up\n\nThe Canadian Press reports:\n\nRead more here.

Smucker Company posted weaker-than-expected earnings as higher commodity costs and consumers pulling back on buying weighed on profits. The stock fell as much as 5% in premarket trading.\n\nThe company's profits fell 22% to $1.90 per share, below estimates for $1.93 per share, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence. Net sales declined 1% to $2.1 billion due to divestitures and unfavorable foreign currency exchange but were roughly in line with estimates.\n\nCoffee sales increased 15% but profits fell 22% due to higher commodity prices and marketing costs. Meanwhile, Net sales declined for peanut butter, but were partially offset by higher pricing for Uncrustables frozen sandwiches.\n\nThe company raised its net sales guidance for the full year to 3% to 5% and kept its earnings per share guidance the same ($8.50-$9.50). Today at 11:56 AM UTC\n\nGrace O'Donnell\n\nHollister fuels Abercrombie & Fitch earnings beat\n\nShares of Abercrombie & Fitch (ANF) were roughly flat in choppy premarket trading after the apparel retailer reported declining net sales in its Abercrombie brand as it lapped tough comparisons. The stock was up over 3% and down 3% at points earlier in the session.\n\nAbercrombie beat Wall Street's expectations: In the second quarter, the company posted record net sales of $1.2 billion, compared to Wall Street estimates of $1.19 billion. Adjusted earnings per share came in at $2.32, slightly above expectations.\n\nNet sales increased 3% year over year, though Hollister was the sales engine. Hollister's comparable net sales jumped 19% year over year, while Abercrombie's fell 11%.\n\nThe retailer raised its full-year net sales guidance to 5% to 7% from 3% to 6% previously and also increased its earnings per share forecast by $0.50 on the low end to a range of $10.00 to $10.50.

Mon, August 25, 2025 at 9:01 PM UTC\n\nGrace O'Donnell\n\nShares of struggling chipmaker Wolfspeed rise as results are better than feared\n\nWolfspeed (WOLF) stock rose just under 1% in after-hours trading following its fiscal fourth quarter results. The struggling chipmaker has been navigating Chapter 11 bankruptcy and is in the midst of a restructuring, after delays in CHIPS Act funding further hampered the company's finances.\n\nWolfspeed reported a loss per share $4.30, compared to a loss of $1.39 per share during the same period a year ago. Revenue came in at $197 million, compared to $201 million the previous year. Wall Street analysts expected worse results.\n\n“Reflecting upon my first three months with Wolfspeed, I am more confident than ever in my decision to join the Company and our opportunity to further strengthen our position in the industry,” Wolfspeed's new CEO, Robert Feurle, said in a statement. “Our next important milestone is for the court to approve our Plan of Reorganization next month, and emerge from Chapter 11 shortly thereafter, with a much stronger financial structure.” Mon, August 25, 2025 at 11:47 AM UTC\n\nGrace O'Donnell\n\nPDD stock jumps after the Temu owner beat earnings estimates\n\nPDD Holdings (PDD) stock gained 7% in premarket trading on Monday after the Chinese e-commerce giant beat earnings estimates by a wide margin.\n\nThe Temu and Pinduoduo owner reported earnings per American depository share (ADS) of 20.75 Chinese yuan (approximately $2.89) compared to estimates of 12.30 yuan ($1.72), per S&P Global Market Intelligence estimates.\n\nRevenue rose 7% year over year to 10.4 billion ($1.45 billion), barely beating estimates as price competition with rivals Alibaba (BABA) and JD.com (JD) and higher costs from tariffs weighed on margins.\n\n“Revenues growth further moderated this quarter amid intense competition,” said Jun Liu, PDD Holdings vice president of finance. \"As we remain focused on long-term value creation, the sustained investments may continue to weigh on short-term profitability.”\n\nRead more here from Reuters Fri, August 22, 2025 at 8:51 PM UTC\n\nGrace O'Donnell\n\nNvidia to highlight next week's earnings\n\nSecond quarter results from Abercrombie & Fitch (ANF), Kohl's (KSS), and Best Buy (BBY) next week will continue to beat the drum of retail earnings after reports from America's big box stores, Walmart (WMT) and Target (TGT).\n\nBut it's Nvidia's (NVDA) earnings that will be the star attraction, as the AI chipmaker's stock has an 8% weighting in the S&P 500 (^GSPC).\n\nAs Yahoo Finance Senior Tech Editor Dan Howley writes, investors will be squarely focused on Nvidia's data center business — even more so since the company announced a new gigascale networking plan that will combine the performance of multiple data centers to create one massive GPU. And many will be eager to hear more about a new China chip Nvidia is developing with the Trump administration.\n\nHere's a look at next week's earnings calendar, marking a sort of grand finale for the second quarter reporting season:\n\nMonday: PDD Holdings (PDD)\n\nTuesday: BMO (BMO), MongoDB (MDB), Okta (OKTA), PVH (PVH)\n\nWednesday: Nvidia (NVDA), Abercrombie & Fitch, CrowdStrike (CRWD), Five Below (FIVE), HP (HP), Kohl's, Pure Storage (PSTG), Snowflake (SNOW), The J.M.

As of today's call, it has doubled to 28%. This includes the additional 30% China tariffs, 50% India tariff, 20% via non-tariff and averaged 18% tariff on the rest of the world as well as the 50% steel and aluminum tariffs and a 50% copper tariff.\"\n\nThe furniture company, which houses brands such as West Elm and Pottery Barn, reported better-than-expected earnings of $2.00 per share. Wall Street expected EPS of $1.80.\n\nWilliams-Sonoma stock was down 1.4% in early afternoon trading. The stock sank earlier this week, along with other furniture stocks, after President Trump posted on social media that his administration would open an investigation into furniture imports and impose additional tariffs on the sector.\n\n\"It's early to speculate — I think we're day 5 of a 50-day probe, there's not a lot of information on this subject,\" Laura Alber, Williams-Sonoma's CEO, said about possible furniture tariffs. \"But I will say that it's going to be very difficult for the industry, even if tariffs are put on to bring a huge amount back to the United States in a short window of time, because there aren't the factories available to do a lot of production.\"\n\n\"For us, of course, we will be in a much better position than most if that were to happen because of our strong USA manufacturing capabilities already,\" Alber continued. \"We have ...

Net sales declined 1% to $2.1 billion due to divestitures and unfavorable foreign currency exchange but were roughly in line with estimates.\n\nCoffee sales increased 15% but profits fell 22% due to higher commodity prices and marketing costs. Meanwhile, Net sales declined for peanut butter, but were partially offset by higher pricing for Uncrustables frozen sandwiches.\n\nThe company raised its net sales guidance for the full year to 3% to 5% and kept its earnings per share guidance the same ($8.50-$9.50).

            "content": "Image Credits:Jonathan Raa/NurPhoto / Getty Images\n\nChatGPT rivals like Google’s Gemini, xAI’s Grok, and, to a lesser extent, Meta AI, are closing the gap to ChatGPT, OpenAI’s popular AI chatbot, according to a new report focused on the consumer AI landscape from venture firm Andressen Horowitz.\n\nThe report, in its fifth iteration, showcases two and a half years of data about consumers’ evolving use of AI products.\n\nAnd for the fifth time, 14 companies appeared on the list of top AI products: ChatGPT, Perplexity, Poe, Character AI, Midjourney, Leonardo, Veed, Cutout, Eleven Labs, Photoroom, Gamma, Quillbot, Civitai, and HuggingFace.Image Credits:a16z\n\nThe companies represent a cross section of how consumers are using AI: for general assistance, companionship, image and video editing, voice generation, productivity, and model hosting.\n\nFive other companies appeared on all but the first report, the firm notes, including Claude, DeepAI, JanitorAI, Pixelcut, and Suno, representing general AI use, companionship, image editing, and music generation.Image Credits:a16z\n\nFor the first time in the series of reports, Google gained four spots on the list of the top gen AI consumer web products with entries for Gemini, AI Studio, NotebookLM, and Google Labs. These products now have their own separate domains, allowing their growth to be tracked separately from one another.\n\na16z says its report relies on data from third-party market intelligence firms, including Similarweb for web products and Sensor Tower for mobile app data.Image Credits:a16z\n\nOf note, No. 2 app Gemini is closing the gap to No. 1 app ChatGPT on mobile devices, but with almost half as many monthly active users. Not surprisingly, Gemini’s AI technology sees stronger adoption on Android, with nearly 90% of the monthly active user base. On the web, Gemini also came in second place behind ChatGPT, with approximately 12% of ChatGPT’s visits.Image Credits:a16z\n\nThe company’s AI Studio, a developer-oriented sandbox for building with Gemini models, entered the top 10 list of AI web products in the 10th spot; NotebookLM was No. 13. Google Labs, a destination for Google’s AI experiments (like Flow, Project Mariner, and Doppl), ranked at No. 39.Image Credits:a16z\n\nThe report indicates that Meta AI and Grok are also chasing the top AI app, ChatGPT.\n\nGrok ranked fourth on the web and No. 23 on mobile. This is quick growth, given that Grok went from having no standalone app at the end of 2024 (it was first launched on X) to now, upwards of 20 million monthly active users. In July 2025, Grok also climbed nearly 40% when Grok 4 was released.Image Credits:a16z\n\nMeta’s general assistant ranked No. 46 on the web — the same as in March — but it didn’t make the list of top mobile AI apps. In part, it was hampered by the news that Meta AI was sharing some users’ posts publicly on the web without their informed consent.\n\nLeer más\n\nImage Credits:a16z\n\nDeepSeek and Claude also saw their growth flatten on mobile, with the former falling off its peak by 22%. On the web, DeepSeek saw an even sharper drop-off, down more than 40% from its peak in February 2025. Perplexity and Claude, however, continued to grow.\n\nOther Chinese AI makers also made the top 20 on the web, including No. 9 Quark, Alibaba’s AI assistant (No. 47 on the mobile list); No. 12 Doubao, ByteDance’s general LLM product (No. 4 on mobile); and No. 17 Kimi, a chatbot from Moonshot AI. Each of these has a Chinese website and sees 75% of its traffic coming from China.\n\nSeven additional companies on the web list were developed in China, but exported their AI tech globally: DeepSeek, Hailuo, Kling, SeaArt, Cutout Pro, Manus, and Monica.\n\nOn mobile, 22 of the 50 top apps were developed in China, but only three were primarily used in China. Top players here include Meitu (Photo & Video Editor, BeautyPlus, BeautyCam, Wink, and Airbrush), ByteDance (Doubao and Cici), Gauth, and Hypic.\n\nVibe-coding startups Lovable and Replit both debuted on the main list this time, having not made the cut on a16z’s list published back in March of this year. (Note that websites built and published via Replit and via Lovable without custom domains appear under traffic for replit.app and lovable.app, respectively, helping them gain traction.)Image Credits:a16z\n\na16z also took time to call out AI apps that were on the brink of making the list of top AI apps, including PixAI, bolt, Blackbox AI, Clipchamp, and Getliner on the web and Talkie, Seekee, Photo AI, AI Mirror, and Arvin on mobile.\n\nThe firm notes that the mobile list in this month’s report already features more newcomers (14) than before, as both app stores have long since cracked down on ChatGPT copycats and clones, allowing for more original apps to find their footing.\n\nVer comentarios",

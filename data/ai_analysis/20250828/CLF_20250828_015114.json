            "title": "The Bull Case For Cleveland-Cliffs (CLF) Could Change Following Lowered Guidance and Cost-Cutting Focus",
            "content": "Earlier in August 2025, Cleveland-Cliffs reported second-quarter results featuring a narrower adjusted loss than expected and revenue that surpassed estimates, despite being down year over year. The company signaled a more cautious outlook for the rest of 2025 by lowering full-year guidance for capital spending and expenses, while emphasizing efforts to cut steel unit costs and enhance operational efficiency. We’ll examine how Cleveland-Cliffs’ renewed focus on cost reductions and updated guidance could influence its investment narrative moving forward.\n\nRare earth metals are an input to most high-tech devices, military and defence systems and electric vehicles. The global race is on to secure supply of these critical minerals. Beat the pack to uncover the 27 best rare earth metal stocks of the very few that mine this essential strategic resource.\n\nCleveland-Cliffs Investment Narrative Recap\n\nTo see value in Cleveland-Cliffs, investors would need to believe in the ongoing benefits from US steel tariffs, domestic manufacturing trends, and the firm's cost-cutting initiatives, while remaining mindful of the competitive and cyclical risks of the steel market. The recent earnings report signaled progress on cost reductions and tighter spending, but it does not materially alter the biggest near-term catalyst, the potential for stronger automotive steel demand, or the primary risk of overreliance on trade barriers, which stays in focus for now.\n\nAmong recent company moves, the launch of a new vertical stainless bright anneal line at Coshocton Works, a US$150 million investment, stands out. This ties closely to management's goal of reducing steel unit costs and achieving greater operational leverage, both of which are central to efforts at improving margins and cash flow as the industry recovers.\n\nYet, in contrast to the optimism around cost improvements, investors should not overlook the ongoing risks from any changes in Section 232 steel tariffs that could suddenly shift...\n\nRead the full narrative on Cleveland-Cliffs (it's free!)\n\nCleveland-Cliffs' narrative projects $22.5 billion revenue and $590.0 million earnings by 2028. This requires 6.8% yearly revenue growth and a $2.29 billion earnings increase from the current -$1.7 billion.\n\nUncover how Cleveland-Cliffs' forecasts yield a $10.90 fair value, a 4% upside to its current price.\n\nExploring Other PerspectivesCLF Community Fair Values as at Aug 2025\n\nNine members of the Simply Wall St Community estimate Cleveland-Cliffs’ fair value from as low as US$2.03 to as high as US$41.89 per share.

            "title": "Comcast and Allstate Look Good on Price-to-Cash-Flow",
            "content": "This article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nAugust 25, 2025 It's my way or the highway.\n\nThat's the attitude of some investment professionals toward stock-selection methods that differ from their own. If astronomers had a narrow view like that, they might spot Jupiter but miss the beautiful rings of Saturn.\n\nThe price-to-cash flow ratio isn't my favorite measure, but I see merit in it, and I devote one column each year to stocks that look good viewed through this lens.\n\nIs COF fairly valued? Test your thesis with our free DCF calculator.\n\nWhat is cash flow? It's an attempt to measure the actual cash flowing through a business. It differs from reported earnings by ignoring non-cash entries such as depreciation and amortization.\n\nIgnoring, in this case, means adding those items back to reported profits. Cash-flow analysts may also add back taxes and interest payments. The theory is that these things aren't an intrinsic part of the business's operations.\n\nA business that's acquiring another business might pay off the debt, and alter the tax situation. So, cash flow is especially interesting to potential acquirers. That's why the price-to-cash-flow ratio can help to identify potential takeover targets.\n\nHere are five companies that look good on this measure to me now.\n\nCapital One\n\nIn my column a year ago about cash flow, the first stock I recommended was Capital One Financial Corp. (NYSE:COF). It rose 52% in the ensuing year. I recommend it again this year as it still sells for five times cash flow, an attractive ratio though not as cheap as a year ago.\n\nThis year, Capital One acquired Discover, making it by some measures the largest U.S. credit-card issuer. I like to see banks earn 1.00% or better on their assets. Capital One has done that in 12 of the past 15 years.\n\nComcast\n\nComcast Corp. (NASDAQ:CMCSA) provides television, phone or Internet service (often, a bundle of the three) to about 31 million homes in the U.S. It also has some business and international customers about 51 million customers in all.\n\nThe dividend yield is about 3.75%, and there is room for Comcast to raise it. Earnings have been consistent, with a profit 22 years in a row. The stock sells for about four times cash flow and eight times free cash flow (which is cash flow adjusted for capital expenditures).\n\nAllstate\n\nRanked by premiums written, Allstate Corp. (NYSE:ALL) is the third-largest auto and home insurance company in the U.S. It used to be number two behind State Farm Group, but has been passed in recent years by Progressive Insurance Group.\n\nStory Continues\n\nAllstate shares go for about six times cash flow. The stock has more than doubled in the past five years. Twenty-one Wall Street analysts follow it, of whom 17 recommend it. I don't usually like to ride with the majority but in this case, I agree with the analysts.\n\nMurphy Oil\n\nTraditional oil-and-gas companies have fallen out of favor. Some investors philosophically prefer solar and wind. Others have abandoned ship on old energy as the price of oil has fallen from more than $100 a barrel in early 2022 to around $63 a barrel now.\n\nI think oil and gas will be a big part of the U.S. energy picture for another two decades. One stock I like in this industry is Murphy Oil Corp. (NYSE:MUR), based in Houston, Texas. Its stock sells for about two times cash flow, and eight times free cash flow.\n\nGray Media\n\nMost speculatively, I recommend Gray Media Inc. (NYSE:GTN), selling for less than two times cash flow. The firm, based in Atlanta, Georgia, owns about 180 television stations serving 113 markets. The company says that it reaches about 37 percent of U.S. households. Many of its stations are in small cities.\n\nWhile TV has been steadily losing market share in advertising to the Internet, it remains an important advertising medium. The company's finances look shaky, but the stock (at about $6, down from a high of near $24) is so cheap as to make it a good speculation in my view.\n\nPerformance\n\nThe stocks I recommended a year ago based on their cash flow returned 29.97%. That handily beat the Standard & Poor's 500 Total Return Index at 15.83%.\n\nA gain of 153% in Tutor Perini Corp. (NYSE:TPC) was mainly responsible for the good result. Capital One also helped, while RPC Inc. (NYSE:RES), Cleveland-Cliffs Inc. (NYSE:CLF) and International Seaways Inc. (NYSE:INSW) detracted.\n\nBear in mind that my column results are hypothetical and shouldn't be confused with results I obtain for clients. Also, past performance doesn't predict the future.\n\nI've previously written 21 columns about price-to-cash-flow. The average return on my recommendations has been 14.6%, versus 10.6% for the index. Fifteen of the 21 columns have shown a profit, while 11 have beaten the benchmark.\n\nDisclosure: I own Allstate and Progressive for a few clients.\n\nJohn Dorfman is chairman of Dorfman Value Investments in Boston. He can be reached at jdorfman@dorfmanvalue.com. He or his clients may own or trade stocks discussed in this column.\n\nView Comments",

Management attributed the performance to ongoing challenges in travel retail, which saw a 28% decline, and persistent softness in key Western markets. CEO Stéphane de la Faverie noted, “Nearly two-thirds of our organic sales decline came from travel retail,” emphasizing the impact of strategic changes and lower conversion rates. Management also acknowledged that inventory adjustments and increased consumer-facing investments weighed on profitability.\n\nIs now the time to buy EL?

Here is what has caught our attention.\n\nOur Top 5 Analyst Questions From Estée Lauder’s Q2 Earnings Call\n\nDara Mohsenian (Morgan Stanley) asked about the pace and cultural impact of restructuring. CEO Stéphane de la Faverie said the new organization is in place and engagement is strong, with further portfolio updates pending. Stephen Powers (Deutsche Bank) requested details on narrowing the gap between retail sales and shipments. CFO Akhil Shrivastava emphasized that inventory levels have improved, and the company expects this gap to compress throughout the year. Lauren Lieberman (Barclays) questioned the North American channel mix and the ongoing challenges with department stores. De la Faverie noted the strategic growth of Amazon and specialty retail, with department stores now representing a smaller portion of sales. Ashley Wallace (Bank of America) pressed on the timeline for non-travel retail business returning to growth. Shrivastava confirmed that excluding travel retail, growth should turn positive in the upcoming year, supported by innovation and distribution efforts. Peter Grom (UBS) inquired about confidence in guidance and embedded risk buffers. Shrivastava responded that the outlook is based on conservative assumptions, with ranges to accommodate ongoing volatility and a disciplined focus on cost control.\n\nStory Continues\n\nCatalysts in Upcoming Quarters\n\nIn the coming quarters, our analysts will focus on (1) the pace of recovery in travel retail and China, (2) evidence that restructuring and cost actions are translating into sustained margin improvement, and (3) the ability of new product launches and channel diversification—especially online—to drive share gains in key markets. Continued progress in emerging markets and effective mitigation of tariff impacts will also be important indicators of execution.\n\nEstée Lauder currently trades at $89.25, in line with $90.01 just before the earnings.

Sometimes research that changes the investing world can come from the halls of academia. Partha Mohanram is a great example of this.

Mohanram turned that research on its head by developing a growth model that produced significant market outperformance. His research paper \"Separating Winners from Losers among Low Book-to-Market Stocks using Financial Statement Analysis\" looked at the criteria that can be used to separate growth stocks that continue their upward trajectory from those that don't.

            "content": "Second quarter earnings season is winding down, and with most of the reports in, the results have been mostly positive.\n\nOver 92% of S&P 500 index companies have reported results, and as of Aug. 18, analysts expected S&P 500 companies to report an 11% jump in earnings per share during the second quarter.\n\nCompanies had lower expectations to clear coming into the quarter — analysts expected S&P 500 earnings to rise 5% in Q2, the slowest pace of earnings growth since Q4 2023 — amid President Trump's tariffs, stocks' lofty valuations, and uncertainty about the health of the US economy.\n\nNvidia (NVDA) results on Wednesday, Aug. 27, highlight this week's earnings\n\nOther companies reporting include PDD Holdings (PDD), Alibaba (BABA), Okta (OKTA), Abercrombie & Fitch (ANF), CrowdStrike (CRWD), Five Below (FIVE), HP (HP), Kohl's (KSS), Snowflake (SNOW), J.M.

Mon, August 25, 2025 at 9:01 PM UTC\n\nGrace O'Donnell\n\nShares of struggling chipmaker Wolfspeed rise as results are better than feared\n\nWolfspeed (WOLF) stock rose just under 1% in after-hours trading following its fiscal fourth quarter results. The struggling chipmaker has been navigating Chapter 11 bankruptcy and is in the midst of a restructuring, after delays in CHIPS Act funding further hampered the company's finances.\n\nWolfspeed reported a loss per share $4.30, compared to a loss of $1.39 per share during the same period a year ago. Revenue came in at $197 million, compared to $201 million the previous year. Wall Street analysts expected worse results.\n\n“Reflecting upon my first three months with Wolfspeed, I am more confident than ever in my decision to join the Company and our opportunity to further strengthen our position in the industry,” Wolfspeed's new CEO, Robert Feurle, said in a statement. “Our next important milestone is for the court to approve our Plan of Reorganization next month, and emerge from Chapter 11 shortly thereafter, with a much stronger financial structure.” Mon, August 25, 2025 at 11:47 AM UTC\n\nGrace O'Donnell\n\nPDD stock jumps after the Temu owner beat earnings estimates\n\nPDD Holdings (PDD) stock gained 7% in premarket trading on Monday after the Chinese e-commerce giant beat earnings estimates by a wide margin.\n\nThe Temu and Pinduoduo owner reported earnings per American depository share (ADS) of 20.75 Chinese yuan (approximately $2.89) compared to estimates of 12.30 yuan ($1.72), per S&P Global Market Intelligence estimates.\n\nRevenue rose 7% year over year to 10.4 billion ($1.45 billion), barely beating estimates as price competition with rivals Alibaba (BABA) and JD.com (JD) and higher costs from tariffs weighed on margins.\n\n“Revenues growth further moderated this quarter amid intense competition,” said Jun Liu, PDD Holdings vice president of finance. \"As we remain focused on long-term value creation, the sustained investments may continue to weigh on short-term profitability.”\n\nRead more here from Reuters Fri, August 22, 2025 at 8:51 PM UTC\n\nGrace O'Donnell\n\nNvidia to highlight next week's earnings\n\nSecond quarter results from Abercrombie & Fitch (ANF), Kohl's (KSS), and Best Buy (BBY) next week will continue to beat the drum of retail earnings after reports from America's big box stores, Walmart (WMT) and Target (TGT).\n\nBut it's Nvidia's (NVDA) earnings that will be the star attraction, as the AI chipmaker's stock has an 8% weighting in the S&P 500 (^GSPC).\n\nAs Yahoo Finance Senior Tech Editor Dan Howley writes, investors will be squarely focused on Nvidia's data center business — even more so since the company announced a new gigascale networking plan that will combine the performance of multiple data centers to create one massive GPU. And many will be eager to hear more about a new China chip Nvidia is developing with the Trump administration.\n\nHere's a look at next week's earnings calendar, marking a sort of grand finale for the second quarter reporting season:\n\nMonday: PDD Holdings (PDD)\n\nTuesday: BMO (BMO), MongoDB (MDB), Okta (OKTA), PVH (PVH)\n\nWednesday: Nvidia (NVDA), Abercrombie & Fitch, CrowdStrike (CRWD), Five Below (FIVE), HP (HP), Kohl's, Pure Storage (PSTG), Snowflake (SNOW), The J.M.

The company's monthly churn rate remained flat year over year at 2.9%.\n\nZoom also raised its full-year revenue outlook and free cash flow guidance, which is now expected to be in the range of $1.74 billion to $1.78 billion.\n\nFor the full 2026 fiscal year, total revenue is expected to be between $4.825 billion and $4.835 billion while diluted EPS is expected to be between $5.81 and $5.84.

Wall Street analysts were expecting earnings per share of $3.64 on revenue of $2.85 billion.\n\nAfter a sluggish spring season in the housing market, there have been signs of a resurgence, with housing starts jumping in July.

Sales in the furniture retailer's wholesale segment increased 1%, and retail sales rose 5%, but they were offset by weakness in the Joybird brand, which saw sales decline 14%.\n\nLa-Z-Boy reported diluted earnings per share of $0.44, compared to $0.61 per share a year ago. The Street was looking for earnings of $0.52 per share.\n\nLa-Z-Boy's guidance also came in lighter than expected.

Reference actual numbers in your reasoning.\n\n3. **Consistency**: Apply the same scoring standards regardless of the stock. A score of 85 should represent the same quality level across all analyses.\n\n4. **Risk Focus**: Pay special attention to red flags that could invalidate the opportunity (poor liquidity, imminent earnings, deteriorating fundamentals).\n\n5. **Strategy Alignment**: Consider how well this opportunity fits options strategies (directional bias, volatility conditions, time decay considerations).\n\n6. **Completeness Check**: If critical data is missing, note it in your analysis but don't penalize the opportunity excessively for data gaps.\n\nAnalyze the EL opportunity now using this framework and respond with the required JSON format.",

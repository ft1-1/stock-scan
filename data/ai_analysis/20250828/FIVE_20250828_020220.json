            "title": "NVIDIA Tops Estimates, Grows +41% on Data Center",
            "content": "Wednesday, August 27, 2025\r\n\r\nIt was another quietly positive day for the stock market, with all four major indexes closing in the green this Hump Day. The Dow gathered another +147 points, +0.32%, while the S&P 500 — notching another all-time closing high in the process — gained +15 points, +0.24%. The Nasdaq was +14, +0.21%, and the small-cap Russell 2000 came in +15 points, +0.64%. Bond yields cooled a few basis points among the 10-year, 2-year and 30-year t-bills.\n\nNVIDIA Reports Healthy Q2, Adds Buyback\n\nThe biggest earnings news of this week just came across the wires in the past few minutes: NVIDIA NVDA, the supreme AI stock play in the world, easily beat estimates on both top and bottom lines — estimates that were already quite extraordinarily high. Earnings of $1.05 per share outpaced the $1.00 expected, and well past the 68 cents per share reported in the year-ago quarter.\r\n\r\nRevenues of $46.7 billion nicely surpassed the $46.14 billion in the Zacks consensus, with $41.1 billion 9n revenues coming from its Data Center segment alone. That’s up +5% quarter over quarter and +56% year over year. Estimates were for +53.6% revenue growth. These are astonishing numbers for the $4+ trillion market cap giant. Adjusted Gross Margins reached +72.7% for the quarter — another magnificent number, though off the +75% NVIDIA was posting a year ago. \r\n\r\nAnd the good news just keeps coming: a $60 billion share buyback was OK’d by the company, which has already awarded shareholders $23.4 billion through the first half of the fiscal year. NVIDIA has $56.8 billion in cash. Yet shares are down -3% on the news; the stock is up +35% year to date, and roughly +90% from its April lows.\n\nOther Earnings Reports This Afternoon: URBN, FIVE, SNOW\n\nUrban Outfitters URBN also put up strong numbers in its Q2 report after today’s close, with earnings of $1.58 per share zooming ahead of the $1.44 anticipated. Revenues of $1.50 billion in the quarter topped consensus of $1.48 billion and amounted to +11.3% year to date. All four of its main brand stores — Anthropologie, Free People, Urban Outfitters and Nully — built gains from the year-ago quarter.\r\n\r\nFive Below FIVE scorched earnings estimates by 20 cents to 81 cents per share on $1.0 billion in revenues, ahead of the $997.3 million expected. Comps came in at +12.4% in the quarter, and guidance for next quarter is way up on both earnings and sales. Shares are up +2.5% in late trading, adding to its +37.5% gains year to date.\r\n\r\nSnowflake SNOW shares are up +12.7% after posting a Q2 report that was beyond expectations: earnings of 35 cents per share swept ahead of the 26 cents in the Zacks consensus on $1.01 billion in sales, which beat the $1.09 billion estimated and +32% year over year. The cloud-based data analytics firm has now beaten earnings estimates in all but one quarter for now 17 quarters.\r\n\r\nQuestions or comments about this article and/or author?

            "content": "Five Below (FIVE) came out with quarterly earnings of $0.81 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.61 per share. This compares to earnings of $0.54 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.\n\nThis quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of +32.79%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this discount retailer would post earnings of $0.83 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.86, delivering a surprise of +3.61%.\n\nOver the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times.\n\nFive Below, which belongs to the Zacks Retail - Miscellaneous industry, posted revenues of $1.03 billion for the quarter ended July 2025, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 2.96%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $830.07 million. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates four times over the last four quarters.\n\nThe sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.\n\nFive Below shares have added about 35.3% since the beginning of the year versus the S&P 500's gain of 9.9%.\n\nWhat's Next for Five Below?\n\nWhile Five Below has outperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?\n\nThere are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.\n\nEmpirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.\n\nAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Five Below was mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nIt will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and the current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is -$0.01 on $923.9 million in revenues for the coming quarter and $4.69 on $4.42 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.\n\nStory Continues\n\nInvestors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Retail - Miscellaneous is currently in the top 31% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.\n\nBuild-A-Bear (BBW), another stock in the same industry, has yet to report results for the quarter ended July 2025. The results are expected to be released on August 28.\n\nThis toy retailer is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.67 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +4.7%. The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.\n\nBuild-A-Bear's revenues are expected to be $114.74 million, up 2.6% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

            "content": "FIVE BELOW (NASDAQ:FIVE [https://www.chartmill.com/stock/quote/FIVE/profile]) delivered a robust second-quarter earnings report that significantly surpassed analyst expectations, driving notable positive momentum in after-hours trading. The discount retailer posted impressive growth figures, reflecting strong consumer demand and effective execution of its value-focused retail strategy.\n\nEARNINGS AND REVENUE PERFORMANCE\n\nThe company reported quarterly revenue of $1.03 billion, marking a substantial 23.7% increase compared to the same period last year. This figure comfortably exceeded the analyst consensus estimate of $1.01 billion. Even more striking was the performance on profitability. FIVE BELOW reported adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $0.81, which was a remarkable 29.4% higher than the average analyst estimate of $0.63. This significant beat on the bottom line indicates not only strong sales but also effective margin management and operational efficiency during the quarter. The company also highlighted a comparable sales increase of 12.4%, underscoring healthy performance at existing stores and suggesting the brand's resonance with its target demographic remains powerful.\n\nMARKET REACTION AND FORWARD GUIDANCE\n\nThe market's immediate reaction to these results was decisively positive. The stock was up approximately 2.35% in after-hours trading following the announcement, a clear signal that investors were pleased with the outperformance. This positive sentiment is further supported by the company's outlook for the upcoming quarter. Management provided revenue guidance with a midpoint of $960 million for Q3, which is approximately 3.8% above the analyst consensus estimate of $947.8 million. This confident forward look suggests that management believes the current tailwinds are not a one-off event but part of a sustainable growth trajectory. By providing guidance that exceeds expectations, the company has effectively given the market reason to be optimistic about the remainder of the fiscal year.\n\nPRESS RELEASE SUMMARY AND CONTEXT\n\nThe core announcement from the company's press release centered on the twin pillars of a 23.7% surge in net sales to $1.0 billion and a 12.4% jump in comparable sales. It also clearly distinguished between its GAAP diluted EPS of $0.77 and the adjusted figure of $0.81. The news summaries corroborate this story of a clear beat on both the top and bottom lines, with particular emphasis on the strength of the EPS surprise and the optimistic guidance for the next quarter. This context paints a picture of a company successfully navigating the economic landscape and gaining market share.\n\nFor a more detailed breakdown of historical earnings, future estimates, and analyst projections, you can review the data here [https://www.chartmill.com/stock/quote/FIVE/earnings-estimates].\n\n_Disclaimer: This article is for informational purposes only and does not constitute financial advice, a recommendation to buy, sell, or hold any security, or an endorsement of any investment strategy.

Reference actual numbers in your reasoning.\n\n3. **Consistency**: Apply the same scoring standards regardless of the stock. A score of 85 should represent the same quality level across all analyses.\n\n4. **Risk Focus**: Pay special attention to red flags that could invalidate the opportunity (poor liquidity, imminent earnings, deteriorating fundamentals).\n\n5. **Strategy Alignment**: Consider how well this opportunity fits options strategies (directional bias, volatility conditions, time decay considerations).\n\n6. **Completeness Check**: If critical data is missing, note it in your analysis but don't penalize the opportunity excessively for data gaps.\n\nAnalyze the FIVE opportunity now using this framework and respond with the required JSON format.",

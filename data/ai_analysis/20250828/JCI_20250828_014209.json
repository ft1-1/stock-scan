            "content": "Let’s dig into the relative performance of Johnson Controls (NYSE:JCI) and its peers as we unravel the now-completed Q2 commercial building products earnings season.\n\nCommercial building products companies, which often serve more complicated projects, can supplement their core business with higher-margin installation and consulting services revenues. More recently, advances to address labor availability and job site productivity have spurred innovation. Additionally, companies in the space that can produce more energy-efficient materials have opportunities to take share. However, these companies are at the whim of commercial construction volumes, which tend to be cyclical and can be impacted heavily by economic factors such as interest rates. Additionally, the costs of raw materials can be driven by a myriad of worldwide factors and greatly influence the profitability of commercial building products companies.\n\nThe 5 commercial building products stocks we track reported a very strong Q2. As a group, revenues beat analysts’ consensus estimates by 2.3% while next quarter’s revenue guidance was in line.\n\nThankfully, share prices of the companies have been resilient as they are up 8.7% on average since the latest earnings results.\n\nJohnson Controls (NYSE:JCI)\n\nFounded after patenting the electric room thermostat, Johnson Controls (NYSE:JCI) specializes in building products and technology solutions, including HVAC systems, fire and security systems, and energy storage.\n\nJohnson Controls reported revenues of $6.05 billion, up 2.6% year on year. This print exceeded analysts’ expectations by 0.7%. Overall, it was a strong quarter for the company with a solid beat of analysts’ organic revenue estimates and a decent beat of analysts’ adjusted operating income estimates.\n\n\"As we celebrate 140 years of innovation and customer commitment, our strong third quarter results and record backlog reflect the momentum we've built and the opportunities ahead,\" said Joakim Weidemanis, CEO.Johnson Controls Total Revenue\n\nUnsurprisingly, the stock is down 3% since reporting and currently trades at $108.21.\n\nIs now the time to buy Johnson Controls?

Despite higher borrowing costs, the economy has avoided flashing recessionary signals. This is the much-desired soft landing that many investors hoped for. The recent rate cuts (0.5% in September and 0.25% in November 2024) have bolstered the stock market, making 2024 a strong year for equities. Donald Trump’s presidential win in November sparked additional market gains, sending indices to record highs in the days following his victory. However, debates continue over possible tariffs and corporate tax adjustments, raising questions about economic stability in 2025.\n\nWant to invest in winners with rock-solid fundamentals?

            "title": "Investing in Johnson Controls International (NYSE:JCI) five years ago would have delivered you a 188% gain",
            "content": "When you buy shares in a company, it's worth keeping in mind the possibility that it could fail, and you could lose your money. But on a lighter note, a good company can see its share price rise well over 100%. For example, the Johnson Controls International plc (NYSE:JCI) share price has soared 158% in the last half decade. Most would be very happy with that. Meanwhile the share price is 1.8% higher than it was a week ago.\n\nLet's take a look at the underlying fundamentals over the longer term, and see if they've been consistent with shareholders returns.\n\nTrump has pledged to \"unleash\" American oil and gas and these 15 US stocks have developments that are poised to benefit.\n\nWhile markets are a powerful pricing mechanism, share prices reflect investor sentiment, not just underlying business performance. One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).\n\nDuring five years of share price growth, Johnson Controls International achieved compound earnings per share (EPS) growth of 24% per year. This EPS growth is reasonably close to the 21% average annual increase in the share price. This indicates that investor sentiment towards the company has not changed a great deal. In fact, the share price seems to largely reflect the EPS growth.\n\nYou can see below how EPS has changed over time (discover the exact values by clicking on the image).NYSE:JCI Earnings Per Share Growth August 26th 2025\n\nWe know that Johnson Controls International has improved its bottom line lately, but is it going to grow revenue? This freereport showing analyst revenue forecasts should help you figure out if the EPS growth can be sustained.\n\nWhat About Dividends?\n\nIt is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. In the case of Johnson Controls International, it has a TSR of 188% for the last 5 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return.\n\nA Different Perspective\n\nIt's nice to see that Johnson Controls International shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 52% over the last year. That's including the dividend. That gain is better than the annual TSR over five years, which is 24%. Therefore it seems like sentiment around the company has been positive lately. In the best case scenario, this may hint at some real business momentum, implying that now could be a great time to delve deeper. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand Johnson Controls International better, we need to consider many other factors. Consider risks, for instance. Every company has them, and we've spotted  3 warning signs for Johnson Controls International  you should know about.\n\nStory Continues\n\nBut note: Johnson Controls International may not be the best stock to buy.

            "content": "What Happened?\n\nA number of stocks jumped in the afternoon session after the major indices rebounded, as Fed Chair Jerome Powell delivered dovish remarks at the much-awaited Jackson Hole symposium. Powell suggested that with inflation risks moderating and unemployment remaining low, the Federal Reserve might consider a shift in its monetary policy stance, including potential interest rate cuts. This outlook eased market concerns about prolonged high interest rates and their impact on economic growth. The prospect of lower borrowing costs bolstered investor confidence, particularly in sectors that have lagged, leading to a broad rally across the market.\n\nThe stock market overreacts to news, and big price drops can present good opportunities to buy high-quality stocks.\n\nAmong others, the following stocks were impacted:\n\nRegional Banks company Popular (NASDAQ:BPOP) jumped 3.1%.

Access our full analysis report here, it’s free.\n\nZooming In On Popular (BPOP)\n\nPopular’s shares are not very volatile and have only had 7 moves greater than 5% over the last year. In that context, today’s move indicates the market considers this news meaningful, although it might not be something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business.\n\nThe previous big move we wrote about was 21 days ago when the stock dropped 3.5% on the news that a surprisingly weak July jobs report and the announcement of sweeping new tariffs fueled fears of an economic slowdown and an impending interest rate cut. The U.S. economy added just 73,000 jobs in July, the weakest gain in over two years, while the unemployment rate rose to 4.2%. This dismal data significantly increased market expectations for a Federal Reserve interest rate cut, with traders now pricing in an 80% probability of a cut in September. Lower interest rates typically harm bank profitability by compressing their net interest margins—the difference between what they earn on loans and pay on deposits. Compounding these worries, the announcement of new tariffs on imports from 92 countries has sparked fears of a global trade war, which could further dampen economic growth and disrupt supply chains, creating a challenging environment for the banking industry.\n\nStory Continues\n\nPopular is up 31.8% since the beginning of the year, and at $122.23 per share, has set a new 52-week high. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of Popular’s shares 5 years ago would now be looking at an investment worth $3,192.\n\nUnless you’ve been living under a rock, it should be obvious by now that generative AI is going to have a huge impact on how large corporations do business.

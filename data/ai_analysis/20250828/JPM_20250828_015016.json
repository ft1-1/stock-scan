            "content": "By Milana Vinn\n\n(Reuters) -JPMorgan Chase has rehired Ofer Harduf from venture capital firm Fifth Wall as the bank continues to bolster its technology team, according to an internal memo seen by Reuters.\n\nHarduf, who will be a managing director in the technology M&A group, will be based in San Francisco. He returns to JPMorgan after spending the past four years as a partner at Fifth Wall, a technology-focused VC firm based in New York.\n\nPrior to joining Fifth Wall in 2021, Harduf spent 9 years at JPMorgan where he focused on gaming, lodging, and real estate technology sectors.\n\n“Ofer’s career spans both investment banking and venture capital, positioning him with a differentiated perspective informed by both principal investing and advisory work across the technology ecosystem,” Jay Hofmann, head of North America M&A, and Vineet Seth, who runs technology M&A for North America, said in the memo sent to employees on Wednesday.\n\nHarduf has added to the growing list of JPMorgan’s recent hires in its tech M&A group on the West Coast.\n\nAmong tech bankers who recently joined JPMorgan are Mark Garcia, vice chair and global head of semiconductors; Eric Quanbeck, managing director and head of applied technology; Brett Miller, managing director and co-head of enterprise and cloud; Peter Duda, managing director supporting software clients; Mike Amex, managing director and head of mid-cap technology services; and Devin Thomas, managing director and head of technology software improvement group M&A.\n\nJPMorgan is expanding its tech M&A group as the investment bank has seen momentum winning advisory mandates in the sector, including Palo Alto Networks' $25 billion acquisition of CyberArk announced in July.\n\n(Reporting by Milana Vinn in New York.

            "content": "Investing.com -- JPMorgan downgraded shares of Krispy Kreme to Underweight from Neutral, citing limited visibility over the company’s proposed turnaround and declining underlying U.S. business trends.\n\nThe analysts said in a note that they continue “to not publish a price target,” highlighting the stock has fallen from its July 2021 IPO price of $17 to around $3.73 as of August 26, with major insider holdings concentrated among five investors, including previous take-private backer JAB.\n\nJPMorgan pointed to the company’s recent profitability hit stemming from costs associated with a now-cancelled direct-to-door (DFD) rollout to support McDonald’s and other national accounts.\n\n“This disruption led to the company being in survivor mode, including the sale of various store assets around the world and an attempted shift to 3P delivery to reduce costs and operational complexity,” the analysts said.\n\nExecution risk is said to remain high, particularly in refranchising international assets, while U.S. organic revenue continues to decline amid pricing pressures and growing competition.\n\nJPMorgan also warned that “the underlying Ebitda profile for the company remains at risk of decline in addition to these non-recurring charges that roll off over time.”\n\nThe report also noted operational challenges with fresh product delivery. “Delivered fresh daily comes with a significant daily last-mile delivery cost…average frequency of fresh doughnut consumption remains at 2-2.5x and 4-6x for loyal/heavy users annually,” JPMorgan said.\n\nJPMorgan suggested that Krispy Kreme could benefit from a strategic owner to unlock value and provide balance sheet flexibility, potentially through longer shelf-stable products that could support a capital-light licensing strategy.\n\nRelated articles\n\nKrispy Kreme shares cut to sell at JPM as turnaround plan faces execution risk\n\nThese Under-the-Radar Stocks Offer Better Risk-Reward Ratio Than Nvidia\n\n7 Undervalued Stocks on the Rise With 50%+ Upside Potential\n\nView Comments",

            "content": "We came across a bullish thesis on Micron Technology, Inc.  on Value investing subreddit by bodaflack. In this article, we will summarize the bulls’ thesis on MU. Micron Technology, Inc. 's share was trading at $117.68 as of August 22nd. MU’s trailing and forward P/E were 21.20 and 8.98 respectively according to Yahoo Finance.Skyworks Solutions, Inc. (SWKS) \"Should Be Up About Five To Seven,\" Says Jim Cramer\n\nPhoto by Yogesh Phuyal on Unsplash\n\nMicron Technology, Inc. (MU) appears significantly undervalued despite strong operational and financial momentum. The company recently guided Q4 EPS to $2.85 ± $0.07, which implies FY2025 forward earnings of $8.11, translating to a P/E of just 14.9. Analysts who updated their price targets post-guidance see substantial upside, with JPM at $185, Needham at $150, and Rosenblatt at $200. Looking further ahead, FY2026 forward P/E is expected to compress further to 8–9, reflecting an extremely low PEG of 0.13 and an EV/EBITDA of 8.5.\n\nMicron maintains a strong balance sheet with $15.7 billion in liquidity, supporting both growth initiatives and shareholder returns. Revenue growth has consistently exceeded 35% year-over-year, with top-line and bottom-line metrics driving substantial cash flow from operations. In Q3 alone, the company generated $3.1 billion in free cash flow, sufficient—under conservative assumptions—to repurchase every share in roughly ten years while maintaining aggressive CAPEX investments.\n\nMicron’s growth trajectory is further supported by secular tailwinds in High Bandwidth Memory (HBM), which is projected to expand at a 30–35% CAGR through 2030, closely aligned with datacenter demand. The company is already sold out of its 2025 HBM supply and is accelerating fab construction to meet future demand, including a $200 billion U.S. investment plan backed by the federal government, with $150 billion earmarked for manufacturing and $50 billion for R&D.\n\nThe Idaho fab, set to come online in 2H 2027, is progressing on schedule. Despite the high-capex nature of the semiconductor business, Micron is executing effectively, generating substantial cash flow to fund expansion while returning significant capital to shareholders, making it a compelling value investment with strong upside potential.\n\nPreviously we covered a bullish thesis on Micron Technology, Inc. (MU) by Oliver | MMMT Wealth in April 2025, which highlighted strong revenue and EBITDA growth, technological leadership in AI memory, and attractive valuation multiples. The stock has appreciated approximately 67.5% since our coverage as growth trends continued. bodaflack shares a similar bullish view but emphasizes recent guidance, HBM demand, and the $200 billion U.S. investment plan as key new catalysts.\n\nStory Continues\n\nMicron Technology, Inc.  is not on our list of the 30 Most Popular Stocks Among Hedge Funds. As per our database, 96 hedge fund portfolios held MU at the end of the first quarter which was 94 in the previous quarter. While we acknowledge the potential of MU as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.

Reference actual numbers in your reasoning.\n\n3. **Consistency**: Apply the same scoring standards regardless of the stock. A score of 85 should represent the same quality level across all analyses.\n\n4. **Risk Focus**: Pay special attention to red flags that could invalidate the opportunity (poor liquidity, imminent earnings, deteriorating fundamentals).\n\n5. **Strategy Alignment**: Consider how well this opportunity fits options strategies (directional bias, volatility conditions, time decay considerations).\n\n6. **Completeness Check**: If critical data is missing, note it in your analysis but don't penalize the opportunity excessively for data gaps.\n\nAnalyze the JPM opportunity now using this framework and respond with the required JSON format.",

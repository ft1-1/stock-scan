            "title": "Cleveland Browns Achieve True Circularity with PureFive™ Resin in Souvenir Cups",
            "content": "PureCycle Technologies\n\nORLANDO, Fla., Aug. 19, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- PureCycle Technologies, Inc. (Nasdaq: PCT) announced today the Cleveland Browns, a professional American football team, will use 100% PureFive™ resin in their 2025 line of player souvenir cups. As PureZero™ partners, the Cleveland Browns and PureCycle have worked together to improve recycling at Huntington Bank Field by delivering polypropylene plastic waste generated at games to PureCycle’s Ironton, Ohio recycling facility. Now the companies are taking it one step further by introducing these sustainable souvenir cups for a true plastics-to-plastics circular solution.\n\nMichele Powell, Cleveland Browns Vice President of Stadium Operations & Event Development said, “This season’s introduction of fully circular player souvenir cups is the latest exciting development from our ongoing sustainability efforts. We’ve worked together with PureCycle for several years to educate fans about recycling at Browns home games and now we’re proud to offer them a sustainable souvenir cup made from recycled PureCycle resin.”\n\nPureCycle CEO Dustin Olson added, “Since the first days of the pilot plant operations, the Browns have been a strong partner by supplying souvenir cups for recycling into high quality PureFive™ resin. It’s been gratifying to watch the relationship grow along with our Company, and to now have our recycled resin landing in the hands of Browns fans this season is a great moment for both organizations. We hope that the Browns’ introduction of recycled content in their concession items will help blaze a trail for more organizations across the sports world who are looking to up their sustainability game.”Cleveland Browns Cup Made with PureFive™ Resin\n\nThe Browns are the first professional sports team to introduce the Run It Back line of cups from Churchill Container. The Run It Back line of cups and containers were introduced by Churchill earlier this year and contain up to 100% PureFive™ resin.\n\nChurchill Container Product Director Erik Johnson said, “The biggest challenge when creating sustainable polypropylene products like the Cleveland Browns’ player souvenir cups is finding a resin that is 100% post-consumer recycled polypropylene and can meet food safety, appearance, odor and processing requirements. Thanks to PureCycle’s dissolution recycling technology, their PureFive™ resin looks and performs similarly to traditional virgin polypropylene resins.”\n\nThe cups will be available for purchase at the Browns first preseason home game on August 23.\n\nAbout PureCycle Technologies\r\nPureCycle Technologies LLC., a subsidiary of PureCycle Technologies, Inc., holds a global license for the only patented dissolution recycling technology, developed by The Procter & Gamble Company (P&G), that is designed to transform polypropylene plastic waste (designated as #5 plastic) into a continuously renewable resource. The unique purification process removes color, odor, and other impurities from #5 plastic waste resulting in our PureFive™ resin that can be recycled and reused multiple times, changing our relationship with plastic. www.purecycle.com\n\nStory Continues\n\nForward-Looking Statements\r\nThis press release contains forward-looking statements, including statements about the continued execution of PureCycle’s business plan, the expected results of tests and trials, the expected timing of commercial sales, and planned future updates.

            "title": "PureCycle Technologies Inc (PCT) Q2 2025 Earnings Call Highlights: Strategic Expansion and ...",
            "content": "Release Date: August 07, 2025\n\nFor the complete transcript of the earnings call, please refer to the full earnings call transcript.\n\nPositive Points\n\nPureCycle Technologies Inc (NASDAQ:PCT) successfully raised $300 million in capital, significantly bolstering its liquidity position and enabling global expansion plans. The company plans to bring approximately 1 billion pounds of installed capacity to the market by 2030, with expansion in Asia, Europe, and the US. PCT has achieved significant progress in its commercial pipeline, with 17 customer applications in post-trial discussions and a backlog of trials continuing to build. The company signed its first major commercial agreement with Emerald for approximately 5 million pounds of purified resin, marking a significant step in revenue generation. Operational reliability at the Ironton facility has improved, with on-stream times approaching 90% and successful rate tests at high production levels, indicating strong operational progress.\n\nNegative Points\n\nThe company's growth plans, particularly in Europe, face delays due to the permitting process, which is different in every region and requires careful navigation. Despite progress, the conversion of trials to sales is a complex process involving supply chain and inventory management challenges, which can delay commercialization. The competitive landscape for feedstock is becoming more challenging, with mechanical recyclers increasing uptake, potentially impacting PCT's feedstock sourcing. PCT's financial performance is still in a ramp-up phase, with expectations for EBITDA break-even at the corporate level not anticipated until late Q4 or early Q1. The company's ambitious growth targets, including the development of Gen 2 facilities, present execution risks, particularly in scaling operations to a 300 million pound facility.\n\nQ & A Highlights\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 6 Warning Signs with PCT.\n\nQ: Can you provide more detail on the growth plans and how they have progressed since the last update? A: Dustin Olsson, CEO: We are excited about our growth projects in Thailand, Antwerp, and our Gen 2 facilities. Thailand is particularly promising due to its existing infrastructure and strategic location, which allows us to address plastic pollution in Asia. Antwerp is in the heart of the recycling universe in Europe, and we are optimistic about the returns there. For Gen 2, we are still deciding on the plant size, but it will have a competitive cost structure, aiming to rival Virgin polypropylene facilities.\n\nQ: Can you elaborate on the 17 applications that are post-trial and the likelihood of their success? A: Dustin Olsson, CEO: We have invested in our commercial team to strategically evaluate customer segments. The 17 trials are in late-stage discussions, indicating that our technology works and customers are approving it. The conversion to sales is happening, and we feel good about the ramp-up discussed previously.\n\nStory Continues\n\nQ: How are you thinking about parceling production and choosing the right customers given the high demand? A: Dustin Olsson, CEO: We are not a commodity polypropylene; we are a specialty product in short supply. Our goal is to show that we can make it in various applications, from automotive to food-grade products. We aim to manage margins across segments and maximize shareholder value by creating a slate of optionality through our funnel.\n\nQ: What are the challenges anticipated in scaling to a 300 million pound Gen 2 facility? A: Dustin Olsson, CEO: We have learned a lot from Ironton and are implementing those learnings into the next lines in Antwerp and Thailand. Our R&D team has conducted fundamental research, giving us confidence in scaling operations. The decision on plant size will come down to cost optimization in the next 6 to 12 months.\n\nQ: Can you update us on the revenue ramp and EBITDA break-even targets for Ironton and the corporate level? A: Dustin Olsson, CEO: We expect revenue ramp in both Q3 and Q4. We aim to exit Q3 at a $4 million per month revenue level, which is close to break-even for Ironton. We still target corporate break-even in the Q4 to Q1 timeline, with $8 million per month as the goal for corporate break-even.\n\nFor the complete transcript of the earnings call, please refer to the full earnings call transcript.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView Comments",

            "title": "PureCycle Technologies, Inc. (PCT) Reports Q2 Loss, Lags Revenue Estimates",
            "content": "PureCycle Technologies, Inc. (PCT) came out with a quarterly loss of $0.35 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of $0.23. This compares to a loss of $0.32 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.\n\nThis quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of -52.17%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this company would post a loss of $0.25 per share when it actually produced a loss of $0.27, delivering a surprise of -8%.\n\nOver the last four quarters, the company has not been able to surpass consensus EPS estimates.\n\nPureCycle Technologies, which belongs to the Zacks Waste Removal Services industry, posted revenues of $1.65 million for the quarter ended June 2025, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 41.07%. This compares to zero revenues a year ago.\n\nThe sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.\n\nPureCycle Technologies shares have added about 26.8% since the beginning of the year versus the S&P 500's gain of 7.9%.\n\nWhat's Next for PureCycle Technologies?\n\nWhile PureCycle Technologies has outperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?\n\nThere are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.\n\nEmpirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.\n\nAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for PureCycle Technologies was mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nIt will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and the current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is -$0.18 on $11.2 million in revenues for the coming quarter and -$0.49 on $33.9 million in revenues for the current fiscal year.\n\nStory Continues\n\nInvestors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Waste Removal Services is currently in the bottom 26% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.\n\nConcrete Pumping (BBCP), another stock in the same industry, has yet to report results for the quarter ended July 2025.\n\nThis company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.06 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -53.9%. The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.\n\nConcrete Pumping's revenues are expected to be $101.4 million, down 7.5% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

            "title": "PureCycle Technologies Second Quarter 2025 Corporate Update",
            "content": "PureCycle Technologies\n\nORLANDO, Fla., Aug. 07, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- PureCycle Technologies, Inc. (Nasdaq: PCT), a U.S.-based company revolutionizing plastic recycling, announced today a corporate update for the second quarter ending June 30, 2025.\n\nManagement Commentary\n\nPureCycle CEO Dustin Olson commented, “We have begun to implement our growth plans following our successful $300 million capital raise that was executed in June. Our first expansion steps will be with facilities in Thailand and Belgium. Future facilities, beyond the initial lines in Thailand and Belgium, are expected to house a Gen 2 Purification design with a planned capacity of more than 300 million pounds per year. All these projects are currently expected to be online by 2030 and would give us an installed capacity of one billion pounds across the United States, Europe and Asia.”\n\nOlson continued, “On the commercial front, we continue to make progress with trials in the packaging, film and textile spaces for both food and non-food applications. Our team is now in negotiations with several companies and working through the process to bring these opportunities to commercialization. We continue to see interest in our PureFive™ resin and are still confident we will achieve increased sales in the second half of 2025 that should position us well for 2026.”\n\nCommercial Update\n\nPureCycle’s compounding and trial successes continued during the second quarter of 2025. Through the Company’s various customer interactions, PureCycle is developing a wide-ranging portfolio of PureFive Choice™ resin grades. This includes one-pellet solutions for food-grade film, injection molded and thermoformed applications.\n\nPureCycle has delivered these PureFive Choice™ resin grades to various converters for trials. The resin has been successfully molded into storage totes, coffee lids, dairy containers, pens and a variety of other polypropylene packaging applications. PureCycle is now in post-trial negotiations for more than 15 applications with numerous converters or brand owners.\n\nThe Company previously announced a partnership with Emerald Carpets to drive circularity in the trade show industry. Emerald signed its commercial supply agreement for approximately 5 million pounds of PureFive™ resin over the next 12 months. The PureFive Choice™ resin will be blended into Emerald Carpets’ existing fiber production and allow for trade shows around the world to use carpets made with recycled content.\n\nPureCycle also made progress on the use of PureFive™ resin in biaxially-oriented polypropylene (BOPP) film. The PureFive Choice™ resin grade for film passed an industrial trial for a leading provider of tapes and films. Work has also continued with Germany-based Brückner Maschinenbau GmbH, the world’s leading supplier of production lines for manufacturing a wide range of stretched films. A larger-scale trial with Brückner is scheduled for later this month and, if successful, should provide PureCycle with thousands of meters worth of samples to share with brand owners. BOPP film has a wide range of end-use applications, including food packaging for snacks, candy and baked goods.\n\nStory Continues\n\nPureCycle has continued to advance through the extensive qualification process with Procter & Gamble (P&G) for a variety of applications. Scaled production tests of the spout and dose caps for select bottles of P&G products are scheduled for September. Products with PureFive™ resin are planned to be in production by the end of 2025 and in stores in early 2026.\n\nOperations Update\n\nPureCycle produced 3.4 million pounds of resin in the second quarter of 2025. The Company took a short, planned outage in early June to update and improve certain areas of the Ironton Facility. The plant returned to operations on June 9, and the facility has been running consistently since then. PureCycle continues to assess the upper limits of the Ironton Facility and successfully completed a rate test at 14,000 pounds per hour on August 1.\n\nTo meet expected demand and better streamline its processes, PureCycle will add compounding operations to the Ironton, Ohio purification facility. The Company has begun efforts to install a new twin-screw extruder with multiple feeders to bring approximately 100 million pounds of annual compounding capacity to the site. This will enable the blending of specific resins for key customer applications, including film, thermoforming and thin-wall injection molding applications. The move is expected to eliminate approximately $4 million of annualized third-party costs currently associated with producing the Company’s PureFive Choice™ resin. It should also further reduce the carbon footprint of PureCycle’s overall supply chain. The integration of compounding to the Ironton Facility should be completed late in the fourth quarter of this year.\n\nPureCycle Financial Update\n\nDuring the second quarter of 2025, PureCycle recognized revenue of approximately $1.7 million.\n\nIn the second quarter of 2025, PureCycle sold a total of $11.9 million of certain Southern Ohio Port Authority Exempt Facility Revenue Bonds (PureCycle Project), Tax-Exempt Series 2020A to a number of qualified institutional buyers. Gross proceeds from the sale of revenue bonds were approximately $10.5 million.\n\nIn June 2025, PureCycle raised $300 million from the issuance of Series B convertible perpetual preferred stock with a series of new and existing investors.\n\nAbout PureCycle Technologies \r\nPureCycle Technologies LLC. (“PCT”), a subsidiary of PureCycle Technologies, Inc., holds a global license for the only patented dissolution recycling technology, developed by The Procter & Gamble Company (P&G), that is designed to transform polypropylene plastic waste (designated as #5 plastic) into a continuously renewable resource. The unique purification process removes color, odor, and other impurities from #5 plastic waste resulting in our PureFive™ resin that can be recycled and reused multiple times, changing our relationship with plastic. www.purecycle.com\n\nForward-Looking Statements\r\nThis press release contains forward-looking statements, including statements about the continued execution of PureCycle’s business plan, the expected results of tests and trials, the expected timing of commercial sales, and planned future updates.

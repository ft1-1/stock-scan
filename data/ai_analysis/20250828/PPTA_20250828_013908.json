            "title": "Antimony Mining Market Experiencing Rapid Growth as a Result of Growing Demand Across Various Sectors",
            "content": "MarketNewsUpdates News Commentary\n\nNEW YORK, Aug. 11, 2025 /CNW/ -- Industry insiders say that the global demand for Antimony market is expected to continue growing for several years to come. Some key uses of antimony include: Antimony alloys improve the durability of lead-acid batteries in military vehicles; Its flame-retardant properties enhance the fire resistance of military uniforms and equipment; and it is used in semiconductors for infrared sensors and night-vision devices. These are crucial for defense technology.  A 2025 report from Research and Markets revealed the antimony market size is expected to see strong growth in the next few years. It will grow to $6.54 billion in 2029 at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 6.9%. The growth in the forecast period can be attributed to advanced electronics, EV revolution, stringent regulations, global economic conditions, exploration and mining developments.  Major trends in the forecast period include green technologies, battery technologies, market expansion in Asia-Pacific, shift towards sustainable antimony production, supply chain challenges and price volatility.  The anticipated growth of the antimony market is attributed to the escalating number of fire accidents and the implementation of rigorous fire safety regulations. According to these regulations, prioritizing prevention is crucial to averting fire-related incidents. The surge in fire accidents has led to an increased demand for fire safety measures, consequently driving up antimony production. Antimony is commonly utilized as a flame inhibitor in fire-resistant apparel, flame retardants, and various fire protection systems. For example, in November 2023, reports from the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA), a non-profit organization based in the United States, revealed that in 2022, local fire departments in the U.S. responded to 1.5 million fire accidents. These incidents resulted in the loss of 3,790 lives, with 13,250 individuals sustaining injuries. The property damage from these fires is estimated to be $18 billion. Moreover, between 2021 and 2022, apartment fire-related deaths increased by 14%, injuries by 7%, and property losses by 6%. Consequently, the surge in fire incidents and the enforcement of stringent fire safety regulations are key drivers for the antimony market.\"  Active mining companies active in markets currently include: Xtra Energy Corporation (OTCPK: XTPT), United States Antimony Corporation (NYSE American: UAMY), Perpetua Resources Corp. (NASDAQ: PPTA), MP Materials Corp. (NYSE: MP), Dateline Resources Limited (OTCQB: DTREF).\n\nStory Continues\n\nMarketNewsUpdates.com | Engaging Premium News Dissemination Services For Emerging Public Companies (PRNewsfoto/MarketNewsUpdates)\n\nResearch and Markets also added in a separate article: \"North America and Europe, together accounting for over 40% share of the global Antimony demand in 2024, are the other major markets. The main applications for Antimony in these regions are centered around the automotive and plastics industries. However, these markets are also characterized by stringent industrial regulatory and safety standards in the areas of environmental and personnel protection, which has put brakes on further demand for the element and its compounds. Recycling of old lead acid batteries to obtain antimony has been an effective strategy to curb ecological harm in these markets, a trend that is now catching up in other regions, too.\"\n\nMajor Antimony Deposit Discovered: American Antimony Corporation - Operating as Xtra Energy Corporation (OTCPK: XTPT) - Confirms Thick, High-Grade Antimony-Gold Dike System at Arrance Mine - Xtra Energy Corporation ($XTPT), a U.S. based company dedicated to securing antimony, a critical mineral vital to national security for its use in defense, semiconductors, and energy storage, is pleased to provide its preliminary drilling report from the Arrance Mine, part of the flagship 4,194 acre American Antimony Project in Nevada's historic Bernice Canyon District.\n\nInvestors are cautioned that these results are preliminary, based primarily on visual logging and portable XRF field analysis, and remain subject to confirmation by certified third-party laboratory assays. Samples have been delivered to American Assay Laboratories in Reno, Nevada, and final results will be released following analysis and review by Company geologists.\n\nProgram Overview - The initial Arrance Mine drilling program consisted of five reverse circulation (RC) drill holes targeting the main felsite dike structure. Of the five holes drilled, four intersected significant stibnite mineralization, and three holes also returned notable gold values from portable XRF screening. The work confirms the presence of a thick, steeply dipping, stibnite-bearing felsite dike system with encouraging gold credits.\n\nDrill Highlights:\n\nHole BC25-02 – First Visual Confirmation of In-Situ Stibnite  - Collar: Lower adit area, Arrance Mine; Dip: –45°; Dike intercept: 115–140 ft (25 ft); Strong, continuous stibnite mineralization throughout; intense QSP alteration; Represents first visual confirmation of in-situ mineralized felsite dike\n\nHole BC25-03 – \"Spectacular Intercept\"  - Same pad as BC25-02; drilled at –20° dip; Dike intercept: 340–625 ft (285 ft continuous); Strong stibnite mineralization throughout; intense alteration; Visible gold confirmed in both high-grade intervals; Arsenic levels are low and well below deleterious thresholds; Preliminary geometry: ~630 ft downhole (~500 ft vertical); Gold (pXRF): 10 ft @ ~80.5 g/t Au (520–530 ft), including 5 ft @ 107 g/t Au; 5 ft @ 190 g/t Au (565–570 ft)\n\nHole BC25-04 – South Step-Out  - Located ~150 ft (50 m) south of BC25-02/03; Dike intercept: 110–145 ft (35 ft); Visual Sb present; represents southern strike continuity of the dike\n\nHole BC25-05 – True Width Confirmation  - Drilled between BC25-02 and BC25-03, opposite azimuth to measure true width; Dike intercept: 440–465 ft (25 ft); Widespread disseminated stibnite and strong alteration; Estimated true width: 30–45 ft (9–14 m)\n\nHole BC25-01 – Northern Periphery Test  - Encountered felsite dikes at 30–65 ft and 205–225 ft; No significant visible stibnite; interpreted as peripheral alteration zone\n\nKey Points -  Drilling confirms a thick, steeply dipping, stibnite-bearing felsite dike at Arrance Mine; True width estimated at 30–45 ft (9–14 m); Apparent down-dip continuity of 285 ft in BC25-03, one of the thickest such intercepts documented in a U.S. Sb system in decades; Bonanza-grade gold (107 g/t and 190 g/t Au) in distinct zones within the dike; Low arsenic levels (<10–50 ppm pXRF) support favorable metallurgy\n\n\"The results from Arrance are extremely exciting,\" said Mac J. Shahsavar, P.Eng., Chairman & CEO of Xtra Energy. \"We have confirmed both the thickness and continuity of the mineralized dike, with visible stibnite and exceptionally low arsenic, plus the added benefit of bonanza gold zones. This combination of scale, grade, and metallurgy is rare in antimony systems. Inspired by recent government support for critical mineral projects, such as the U.S. Department of Defense's multibillion-dollar investment in MP Materials and the $24.8 million award to Perpetua Resources for antimony processing with FAST-41 permitting support, we look forward to advancing the Arrance project toward defining a domestic, world-class critical mineral resource that has the ability to help the U.S. with its national security interests.\" CONTINUED… Read this and more news for XTPT at: https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/XTPT/news/\n\nIn other mining developments and happenings in the markets include:\n\nUnited States Antimony Corporation (NYSE American: UAMY) recently announced that it has completed an acquisition of 100% of the ownership interest of the Fostung Properties which cover fifty (50) single-cell mining claims or 1,114 hectares located approximately 70 kilometers west-southwest of Sudbury, Ontario, Canada, near the town of Espanola.

            "content": "15,000m drill program commenced at the Estelle\r\nProject targeting Gold at RPM, Korbel and Antimony at Stibium\n\nU.S. Department of Defense grant to fast-track development of the Antimony Project, at an advanced stage with the Company anticipating an update in the near term.\n\nMelbourne, Australia, July  29, 2025  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Nova Minerals Limited (“Nova” and the “Company”) (NASDAQ: NVA) (ASX: NVA), (FRA: QM3), a gold and critical minerals exploration stage company focused on advancing the Estelle Gold and Critical Minerals Project in Alaska, U.S.A. provides its quarterly activities and cashflow report for the quarter ended June 30, 2025\n\nHighlights\n\nEstelle Project\n\n15,000m drill program commenced across the project area in June 2025 with a focus on advancing the RPM and Korbel gold deposits toward feasibility and permitting, while also initiating a maiden resource at the Stibium prospect for both gold and antimony. With both metals trading near historic highs, the strategic significance and potential economic return of these near-surface assets underscore Nova’s planned strong growth trajectory and long term value proposition\n\nGold Assets – Over 20 Prospects Advancing Including 4 Large Gold Deposits\n\nRPM Drill Program\n\n10,000-meter drill program at the RPM deposit commenced in July 2025 which is strategically designed to enhance resource definition and expand mineralization across multiple target zones. A major focus is the RPM deposit itself, where drilling will test the eastern strike extension beneath a fractured zone encountered in historic hole RPM-004, with particular emphasis on intersecting the high-grade hornfels/intrusive contact — a proven host of significant gold mineralization. Additional drilling will aim to upgrade measured and indicated resources and explore the potential of intrusive dikes to the south. The program will also target further expansion to the west, focusing again on the key contact zone within the valley (Figure 1).Exploration will also extend beyond the main RPM deposit. Reverse-circulation (RC) drilling is planned to the north of the RPM North deposit, where geochemical anomalies along a ridgeline suggest strong mineral potential. Another RC drill campaign will target the RPM glacial debris lobe, a highly prospective area defined by surface samples collected in 2024, which included rock grades up to 52.3 g/t Au and till samples averaging 1.1 g/t Au across 1.7 kilometers (ASX Announcement: 3 February 2025 and Figure 2). These high-grade surface expressions present a compelling opportunity for new discoveries within the broader RPM system.In addition to resource growth and exploration, the drill program will include the installation of hydrology wells to better understand surface and groundwater systems in the region. This work will contribute to an expanded environmental baseline and support future permitting efforts. Together, these initiatives are designed to position RPM for long-term development while unlocking additional value through resource upgrades, discovery drilling, and critical pre-feasibility infrastructure.\n\nKorbel Drill Program\n\n~2,000m of drilling at Korbel will target a potential higher-grade starter pit at Korbel Main, with flexibility to expand into other high-priority targets within the broader valley (Figure 5).\n\nSurface Sampling Program\n\nA comprehensive regional surface exploration program is underway alongside drilling at the Estelle Project, aimed at identifying and advancing new high-priority prospects to drive future resource growth. Field teams are conducting geological mapping, geochemical sampling, and target delineation across key areas, including expanded coverage north of Korbel, denser sampling between Portage Pass and Tomahawk, and follow-up work at West Wing, Styx, and the greater Train area (Figure 6). These zones, particularly near the intrusive/hornfels contacts, offer strong potential for new mineralization, while infill sampling at RPM and Styx will further refine existing targets and support ongoing exploration success.\n\nAntimony Assets – 7 Gold-Antimony Prospects with U.S. Grant Applications Advanced\n\nStibium Antimony-Gold Drill Program\n\nApproximately 3,000m of drilling commenced at the Stibium prospect in June 2025, targeting the establishment of a maiden mineral resource estimate for both gold and antimony. Surface sampling has defined a substantial mineralised zone, approximately 800m long and 400m wide, with high impact results including (ASX Announcement: 14 January 2025 and Figures 3 and 4):\n\n12 rock samples > 30% Sb with a high of 60.5% Sb 10 soil samples > 0.1% Sb with a high of 2.8% Sb 16 rock samples > 5 g/t Au with a high of 141 g/t Au 35 soil samples > 1 g/t Au with a high of 25.6 g/t Au\n\nNova’s U.S. Department of Defense Grant Application at an Advanced Stage\n\nNova’s application for potential U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) funding—designed to fast-track the development of a mineral resource estimate, processing, refining, and eventual antimony production at Estelle—progressed significantly during the quarter and is now in its final stages. We anticipate receiving an update in the near term.A successful outcome would enable the Company to expand its 2025 drilling program by deploying additional diamond drill rigs, allowing for extended drilling at the Stibium prospect and initial testing at the highly prospective Styx target. Notably, peer companies such as MP Materials (NYSE: MP with a market capitalization of ~A$17.5 billion at 30 June 2025) and Perpetua Resources (NASDAQ: PPTA with a market capitalization of ~A$2.18 billion at 30 June 2025) have already secured DoD funding, highlighting the program’s potential to support strategic mineral development.\n\nCorporate\n\nAt the end of the June 2025 quarter, Nova had A$9.08 million in cash, and no debt. The above cash balance excludes the US$12.1 million (A$18.4 million) raised in the subsequent July 2025 U.S. offering as described below. In July 2025 the Company subsequently raised a total of US$12.1 million (A$18.4 million) before costs through a U.S offering, for drilling and exploration programs, feasibility studies, and general working capital.On 24 June 2025 the Company announced the appointment of Mr. Chaim (Dovi) Berger as an Independent Non-Executive Director with effect from 1 July 2025. Mr. Berger is a U.S.-based attorney and CPA with over a decade of experience in corporate law, finance, and M&A, known for executing complex transactions, leading high-growth operations, and implementing strategic financial and compliance controls. Mr. Berger has been appointed to the Audit & Risk Committee and the Remuneration & Nomination Committee.Notable investing and operating cash flow items during the quarter included: A$1.9M exploration and evaluation costs, principally related to drilling, the PFS test work, mining and environmental studies, sample analysis, and camp running costs, A$432k administration and corporate expenses, the majority of which are related to marketing and share registry costs, and A$797k for professional fees related mainly to investor relations and consulting and advice in respect of the antimony grant.Payments to related parties in Q4 FY25 were A$262K and included CEO and Executive remuneration and non-executive director fees.\n\nNext Steps\n\nPotentially secure U.S. Department of Defense funding for antimony supplyMaterial PFS test work results and trade-off studies as they become available Metallurgical test work ongoingEnvironmental test work ongoing West Susitna Access Road updatesInfrastructure permitting2025 drilling and surface exploration program resultsUpdated Mineral Resource Estimate (MRE) to both JORC and S-K 1300 standards for gold and antimony\n\nFigure 1. 2025 drill target areas at/near the RPM deposit\n\nFigure 2. 2025 exploration drill targets outside the main RPM deposit zone\n\nFigure 3.

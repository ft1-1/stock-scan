            "content": "Revenue of $46.7 billion, up 6% from Q1 and up 56% from a year agoData Center revenue of $41.1 billion, up 5% from Q1 and up 56% from a year agoBlackwell Data Center revenue grew 17% sequentially\n\nSANTA CLARA, Calif., Aug.  27, 2025  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- NVIDIA (NASDAQ: NVDA) today reported revenue for the second quarter ended July 27, 2025, of $46.7 billion, up 6% from the previous quarter and up 56% from a year ago. NVIDIA’s Blackwell Data Center revenue grew 17% sequentially.\n\nThere were no H20 sales to China-based customers in the second quarter. NVIDIA benefited from a $180 million release of previously reserved H20 inventory, from approximately $650 million in unrestricted H20 sales to a customer outside of China.\n\nFor the quarter, GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins were 72.4% and 72.7%, respectively. Excluding the $180 million release, non-GAAP gross margin for the quarter would have been 72.3%.\n\nFor the quarter, GAAP and non-GAAP earnings per diluted share were $1.08 and $1.05, respectively. Excluding the $180 million release and related tax impact, non-GAAP diluted earnings per share for the quarter would have been $1.04.\n\n“Blackwell is the AI platform the world has been waiting for, delivering an exceptional generational leap — production of Blackwell Ultra is ramping at full speed, and demand is extraordinary,” said Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of NVIDIA. “NVIDIA NVLink rack-scale computing is revolutionary, arriving just in time as reasoning AI models drive orders-of-magnitude increases in training and inference performance. The AI race is on, and Blackwell is the platform at its center.”\n\nDuring the first half of fiscal 2026, NVIDIA returned $24.3 billion to shareholders in the form of shares repurchased and cash dividends. As of the end of the second quarter, the company had $14.7 billion remaining under its share repurchase authorization. On August 26, 2025, the Board of Directors approved an additional $60.0 billion to the Company’s share repurchase authorization, without expiration.\n\nNVIDIA will pay its next quarterly cash dividend of $0.01 per share on October 2, 2025, to all shareholders of record on September 11, 2025.\n\nQ2 Fiscal 2026 Summary\n\nGAAP ($ in millions, except earnings per share)Q2 FY26Q1 FY26Q2 FY25Q/QY/YRevenue$46,743$44,062$30,0406%56%Gross margin72.4%60.5%75.1%11.9 pts(2.7) ptsOperating expenses$5,413$5,030$3,9328%38%Operating income$28,440$21,638$18,64231%53%Net income$26,422$18,775$16,59941%59%Diluted earnings per share$1.08$0.76$0.6742%61%\n\nNon-GAAP($ in millions, except earnings per share)Q2 FY26Q1 FY26Q2 FY25Q/QY/YRevenue$46,743$44,062$30,0406%56%Gross margin72.7%61.0%75.7%11.7 pts(3.0) ptsGross margin excluding H20 related charges/releases, net 72.3%71.3% 1.0 pt Operating expenses$3,795$3,583$2,7926%36%Operating income$30,165$23,275$19,93730%51%Net income$25,783$19,894$16,95230%52%Diluted earnings per share $1.05$0.81$0.6830%54%Diluted earnings per share excluding H20 related charges/releases, net and related tax impact$1.04$0.96 8%\n\nOutlook\r\nNVIDIA’s outlook for the third quarter of fiscal 2026 is as follows:\n\nRevenue is expected to be $54.0 billion, plus or minus 2%.

The webcast will be recorded and available for replay until NVIDIA’s conference call to discuss its financial results for its third quarter of fiscal 2026.\n\nNon-GAAP Measures\r\nTo supplement NVIDIA’s condensed consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with GAAP, the company uses non-GAAP measures of certain components of financial performance. These non-GAAP measures include non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP other income (expense), net, non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP net income, or earnings, per diluted share, and free cash flow. For NVIDIA’s investors to be better able to compare its current results with those of previous periods, the company has shown a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures. These reconciliations adjust the related GAAP financial measures to exclude stock-based compensation expense, acquisition-related and other costs, other, gains/losses from non-marketable and publicly-held equity securities, net, interest expense related to amortization of debt discount, H20 related charges/releases, net and the associated tax impact of these items where applicable. The inclusion of H20 related charges/releases, net in the reconciliations to adjust the related GAAP financial measures was a result of the U.S. government informing NVIDIA in April 2025 that it requires a license for export to China of H20 product. The H20 product was designed primarily for the China market. Free cash flow is calculated as GAAP net cash provided by operating activities less both purchases related to property and equipment and intangible assets and principal payments on property and equipment and intangible assets. NVIDIA believes the presentation of its non-GAAP financial measures enhances the user’s overall understanding of the company’s historical financial performance. The presentation of the company’s non-GAAP financial measures is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the company’s financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP, and the company’s non-GAAP measures may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies.\n\nNVIDIA CORPORATION CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME(In millions, except per share data)(Unaudited)   Three Months Ended Six Months Ended July 27, July 28, July 27, July 28, 2025 2024 2025 2024 Revenue$46,743  $30,040  $90,805  $56,084 Cost of revenue 12,890   7,466   30,284   13,105 Gross profit 33,853   22,574   60,521   42,979  Operating expenses Research and development 4,291   3,090   8,280   5,810 Sales, general and administrative 1,122   842   2,163   1,618 Total operating expenses 5,413   3,932   10,443   7,428  Operating income 28,440   18,642   50,078   35,551 Interest income 592   444   1,108   803 Interest expense (62)  (61)  (124)  (125)Other income (expense), net 2,236   189   2,055   264 Total other income (expense), net 2,766   572   3,039   942  Income before income tax 31,206   19,214   53,117   36,493 Income tax expense 4,784   2,615   7,920   5,013 Net income$ 26,422  $ 16,599  $ 45,197  $ 31,480  Net income per share: Basic$1.08  $0.68  $1.85  $1.28 Diluted$1.08  $0.67  $1.84  $1.27  Weighted average shares used in per share computation: Basic 24,366   24,578   24,404   24,599 Diluted 24,532   24,848   24,571   24,869\n\nNVIDIA CORPORATIONCONDENSED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS(In millions)(Unaudited)   July 27, January 26, 2025 2025ASSETS  Current assets: Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities$56,791 $43,210Accounts receivable, net 27,808  23,065Inventories 14,962  10,080Prepaid expenses and other current assets 2,658  3,771Total current assets 102,219  80,126 Property and equipment, net 9,141  6,283Operating lease assets 2,084  1,793Goodwill 5,755  5,188Intangible assets, net 755  807Deferred income tax assets 13,570  10,979Other assets 7,216  6,425Total assets$ 140,740 $ 111,601 LIABILITIES AND SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY Current liabilities: Accounts payable$9,064 $6,310Accrued and other current liabilities 15,193  11,737Total current liabilities 24,257  18,047 Long-term debt 8,466  8,463Long-term operating lease liabilities 1,831  1,519Other long-term liabilities 6,055  4,245Total liabilities 40,609  32,274 Shareholders' equity 100,131  79,327Total liabilities and shareholders' equity$ 140,740 $ 111,601\n\nNVIDIA CORPORATIONCONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS(In millions)(Unaudited)   Three Months Ended Six Months Ended July 27, July 28, July 27, July 28, 2025 2024 2025 2024 Cash flows from operating activities: Net income$26,422  $16,599  $45,197  $31,480 Adjustments to reconcile net income to net cash provided by operating activities: Stock-based compensation expense 1,624   1,154   3,099   2,164 Depreciation and amortization 668   433   1,280   843 Deferred income taxes 18   (1,699)  (2,160)  (3,276)Gains on non-marketable equity securities and publicly-held equity securities, net (2,247)  (193)  (2,073)  (264)Other (100)  (144)  (196)  (288)Changes in operating assets and liabilities, net of acquisitions: Accounts receivable (5,675)  (1,767)  (4,743)  (4,133)Inventories (3,622)  (803)  (4,880)  (1,380)Prepaid expenses and other assets 387   714   946   (12)Accounts payable 1,314   823   2,255   801 Accrued and other current liabilities (4,053)  (888)  3,075   3,314 Other long-term liabilities 629   260   979   584 Net cash provided by operating activities 15,365   14,489   42,779   29,833  Cash flows from investing activities: Proceeds from maturities of marketable securities 3,130   4,094   6,252   8,098 Proceeds from sales of marketable securities 20   15   487   164 Proceeds from sales of non-marketable equity securities 70   50   70   105 Purchases of marketable securities (7,812)  (5,744)  (14,358)  (15,047)Purchase related to property and equipment and intangible assets (1,894)  (977)  (3,122)  (1,346)Purchases of non-marketable equity securities (346)  (344)  (995)  (534)Acquisitions, net of cash acquired (294)  (279)  (677)  (317)Net cash used in investing activities (7,126)  (3,185)  (12,343)  (8,877) Cash flows from financing activities: Proceeds related to employee stock plans -

NVIDIA’s Blackwell Data Center revenue grew 17% sequentially.\n\nThere were no H20 sales to China-based customers in the second quarter. NVIDIA benefited from a $180 million release of previously reserved H20 inventory, from approximately $650 million in unrestricted H20 sales to a customer outside of China.\n\nFor the quarter, GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins were 72.4% and 72.7%, respectively. Excluding the $180 million release, non-GAAP gross margin for the quarter would have been 72.3%.\n\nFor the quarter, GAAP and non-GAAP earnings per diluted share were $1.08 and $1.05, respectively. Excluding the $180 million release and related tax impact, non-GAAP diluted earnings per share for the quarter would have been $1.04.\n\n“Blackwell is the AI platform the world has been waiting for, delivering an exceptional generational leap — production of Blackwell Ultra is ramping at full speed, and demand is extraordinary,” said Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of NVIDIA. “NVIDIA NVLink rack-scale computing is revolutionary, arriving just in time as reasoning AI models drive orders-of-magnitude increases in training and inference performance. The AI race is on, and Blackwell is the platform at its center.”\n\nDuring the first half of fiscal 2026, NVIDIA returned $24.3 billion to shareholders in the form of shares repurchased and cash dividends. As of the end of the second quarter, the company had $14.7 billion remaining under its share repurchase authorization. On August 26, 2025, the Board of Directors approved an additional $60.0 billion to the Company’s share repurchase authorization, without expiration.\n\nNVIDIA will pay its next quarterly cash dividend of $0.01 per share on October 2, 2025, to all shareholders of record on September 11, 2025.\n\nQ2 Fiscal 2026 Summary\n\nGAAP  ($ in millions, except earnings per share) Q2 FY26 Q1 FY26 Q2 FY25 Q/Q Y/Y Revenue $46,743 $44,062 $30,040 6% 56% Gross margin 72.4% 60.5% 75.1% 11.9 pts (2.7) pts Operating expenses $5,413 $5,030 $3,932 8% 38% Operating income $28,440 $21,638 $18,642 31% 53% Net income $26,422 $18,775 $16,599 41% 59% Diluted earnings per share $1.08 $0.76 $0.67 42% 61%\n\nNon-GAAP ($ in millions, except earnings per share) Q2 FY26 Q1 FY26 Q2 FY25 Q/Q Y/Y Revenue $46,743 $44,062 $30,040 6% 56% Gross margin 72.7% 61.0% 75.7% 11.7 pts (3.0) pts Gross margin excluding H20 related charges/releases, net  72.3% 71.3%  1.0 pt  Operating expenses $3,795 $3,583 $2,792 6% 36% Operating income $30,165 $23,275 $19,937 30% 51% Net income $25,783 $19,894 $16,952 30% 52% Diluted earnings per share  $1.05 $0.81 $0.68 30% 54% Diluted earnings per share excluding H20 related charges/releases, net and related tax impact $1.04 $0.96  8%\n\nOutlook\r\nNVIDIA’s outlook for the third quarter of fiscal 2026 is as follows:\n\nStory Continues\n\nRevenue is expected to be $54.0 billion, plus or minus 2%.

A live webcast (listen-only mode) of the conference call will be accessible at NVIDIA’s investor relations website, https://investor.nvidia.com. The webcast will be recorded and available for replay until NVIDIA’s conference call to discuss its financial results for its third quarter of fiscal 2026.\n\nNon-GAAP Measures\r\nTo supplement NVIDIA’s condensed consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with GAAP, the company uses non-GAAP measures of certain components of financial performance. These non-GAAP measures include non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP other income (expense), net, non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP net income, or earnings, per diluted share, and free cash flow. For NVIDIA’s investors to be better able to compare its current results with those of previous periods, the company has shown a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures. These reconciliations adjust the related GAAP financial measures to exclude stock-based compensation expense, acquisition-related and other costs, other, gains/losses from non-marketable and publicly-held equity securities, net, interest expense related to amortization of debt discount, H20 related charges/releases, net and the associated tax impact of these items where applicable. The inclusion of H20 related charges/releases, net in the reconciliations to adjust the related GAAP financial measures was a result of the U.S. government informing NVIDIA in April 2025 that it requires a license for export to China of H20 product. The H20 product was designed primarily for the China market. Free cash flow is calculated as GAAP net cash provided by operating activities less both purchases related to property and equipment and intangible assets and principal payments on property and equipment and intangible assets. NVIDIA believes the presentation of its non-GAAP financial measures enhances the user’s overall understanding of the company’s historical financial performance. The presentation of the company’s non-GAAP financial measures is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the company’s financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP, and the company’s non-GAAP measures may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies.\n\nNVIDIA CORPORATION CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME (In millions, except per share data) (Unaudited)   Three Months Ended  Six Months Ended July 27,  July 28,  July 27,  July 28, 2025  2024  2025  2024  Revenue $ 46,743   $ 30,040   $ 90,805   $ 56,084  Cost of revenue  12,890    7,466    30,284    13,105  Gross profit  33,853    22,574    60,521    42,979   Operating expenses  Research and development  4,291    3,090    8,280    5,810  Sales, general and administrative  1,122    842    2,163    1,618  Total operating expenses  5,413    3,932    10,443    7,428   Operating income  28,440    18,642    50,078    35,551  Interest income  592    444    1,108    803  Interest expense  (62 )   (61 )   (124 )   (125 ) Other income (expense), net  2,236    189    2,055    264  Total other income (expense), net  2,766    572    3,039    942   Income before income tax  31,206    19,214    53,117    36,493  Income tax expense  4,784    2,615    7,920    5,013  Net income $ 26,422   $ 16,599   $ 45,197   $ 31,480   Net income per share:  Basic $ 1.08   $ 0.68   $ 1.85   $ 1.28  Diluted $ 1.08   $ 0.67   $ 1.84   $ 1.27   Weighted average shares used in per share computation:  Basic  24,366    24,578    24,404    24,599  Diluted  24,532    24,848    24,571    24,869\n\nNVIDIA CORPORATION CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS (In millions) (Unaudited)   July 27,  January 26, 2025  2025 ASSETS   Current assets:  Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities $ 56,791  $ 43,210 Accounts receivable, net  27,808   23,065 Inventories  14,962   10,080 Prepaid expenses and other current assets  2,658   3,771 Total current assets  102,219   80,126  Property and equipment, net  9,141   6,283 Operating lease assets  2,084   1,793 Goodwill  5,755   5,188 Intangible assets, net  755   807 Deferred income tax assets  13,570   10,979 Other assets  7,216   6,425 Total assets $ 140,740  $ 111,601  LIABILITIES AND SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY  Current liabilities:  Accounts payable $ 9,064  $ 6,310 Accrued and other current liabilities  15,193   11,737 Total current liabilities  24,257   18,047  Long-term debt  8,466   8,463 Long-term operating lease liabilities  1,831   1,519 Other long-term liabilities  6,055   4,245 Total liabilities  40,609   32,274  Shareholders' equity  100,131   79,327 Total liabilities and shareholders' equity $ 140,740  $ 111,601\n\nNVIDIA CORPORATION CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS (In millions) (Unaudited)   Three Months Ended  Six Months Ended July 27,  July 28,  July 27,  July 28, 2025  2024  2025  2024  Cash flows from operating activities:  Net income $ 26,422   $ 16,599   $ 45,197   $ 31,480  Adjustments to reconcile net income to net cash provided by operating activities:  Stock-based compensation expense  1,624    1,154    3,099    2,164  Depreciation and amortization  668    433    1,280    843  Deferred income taxes  18    (1,699 )   (2,160 )   (3,276 ) Gains on non-marketable equity securities and publicly-held equity securities, net  (2,247 )   (193 )   (2,073 )   (264 ) Other  (100 )   (144 )   (196 )   (288 ) Changes in operating assets and liabilities, net of acquisitions:  Accounts receivable  (5,675 )   (1,767 )   (4,743 )   (4,133 ) Inventories  (3,622 )   (803 )   (4,880 )   (1,380 ) Prepaid expenses and other assets  387    714    946    (12 ) Accounts payable  1,314    823    2,255    801  Accrued and other current liabilities  (4,053 )   (888 )   3,075    3,314  Other long-term liabilities  629    260    979    584  Net cash provided by operating activities  15,365    14,489    42,779    29,833   Cash flows from investing activities:  Proceeds from maturities of marketable securities  3,130    4,094    6,252    8,098  Proceeds from sales of marketable securities  20    15    487    164  Proceeds from sales of non-marketable equity securities  70    50    70    105  Purchases of marketable securities  (7,812 )   (5,744 )   (14,358 )   (15,047 ) Purchase related to property and equipment and intangible assets  (1,894 )   (977 )   (3,122 )   (1,346 ) Purchases of non-marketable equity securities  (346 )   (344 )   (995 )   (534 ) Acquisitions, net of cash acquired  (294 )   (279 )   (677 )   (317 ) Net cash used in investing activities  (7,126 )   (3,185 )   (12,343 )   (8,877 )  Cash flows from financing activities:  Proceeds related to employee stock plans  -

            "content": "NVIDIA is integrating its cutting-edge AI technologies across various industry sectors. This includes enhancing VMware Cloud Foundation with Broadcom and deploying RTX PRO Servers across major enterprises like Disney and TSMC. Over the past quarter, NVDA's stock soared 35%, reflecting momentum from these initiatives. Meanwhile, the market saw a 1.3% rise as investors anticipated positive earnings across tech stocks. Noteworthy collaborations, including Galbot's adoption of NVIDIA's Jetson AGX Thor, likely bolstered investor confidence amidst a generally rising market, further lifting NVDA amidst broader optimism ahead of its earnings report.\n\nWe've discovered 1 weakness for NVIDIA that you should be aware of before investing here.NVDA Earnings Per Share Growth as at Aug 2025\n\nExplore 23 top quantum computing companies leading the revolution in next-gen technology and shaping the future with breakthroughs in quantum algorithms, superconducting qubits, and cutting-edge research.\n\nNVIDIA's recent advances, including AI integrations with VMware and deployments in enterprises like Disney, underscore significant strides in the technology sector. Over the past five years, the company's total shareholder return has been very large, a testament to its substantial growth and innovation. Over the past year, NVIDIA outperformed the US Semiconductor industry, which returned 34.4%, and the broader US market with a 16.2% return. This context highlights NVIDIA's robust standing in an evolving market landscape.\n\nThese initiatives may bolster NVIDIA's revenue and earnings forecasts, as its AI technologies solidify its presence across critical industries like data centers and autonomous vehicles. The focus on Blackwell architecture and AI model scaling is expected to support competitive positioning and enhance margins by increasing infrastructure investments. This focus could, therefore, positively influence revenue projections, supporting the analysts' assumptions of significant growth. The current share price of US$181.77, compared to the consensus price target of US$194.22, suggests room for potential appreciation but means it currently trades at a 6.85% discount to analyst targets. As NVIDIA continues to leverage partnerships and product expansions, investor sentiment appears positive in anticipation of further earnings potential.\n\nUnlock comprehensive insights into our analysis of NVIDIA stock in this financial health report.\n\nThis article by Simply Wall St is general in nature.

            "content": "SAN FRANCISCO, Aug.  27, 2025  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- A newly filed class-action lawsuit targets Sable Offshore Corp. (NYSE: SOC) and its executives, alleging the company misrepresented its oil production status to investors. The litigation, filed in federal court in California, claims the company used a misleading press release to artificially inflate its stock price just before a secondary public offering (SPO).\n\nHagens Berman urges Sable investors who suffered substantial losses to submit your losses now.\n\nClass Period: May 19, 2025 – June 3, 2025\r\nLead Plaintiff Deadline: Sept. 26, 2025\r\nVisit:www.hbsslaw.com/investor-fraud/soc\r\nContact the Firm Now:SOC@hbsslaw.com\r\n 844-916-0895\n\nAllegations of Misleading Statements and Regulatory Clash\n\nThe lawsuit, Johnson v. Sable Offshore Corp., represents investors who purchased Sable Offshore securities between May 19, 2025, and June 3, 2025, including those who bought shares in the May 21, 2025 SPO.\n\nAccording to the complaint, Sable Offshore issued a press release on May 19, 2025, that claimed it had restarted oil production off the California coast. This statement was allegedly false and misleading. California Lieutenant Governor Eleni Kounalakis publicly challenged this claim, stating in a letter that the company’s press release appears to mischaracterize its activities. She clarified that the oil flows were merely well-testing procedures, not a resumption of commercial production.\n\nFollowing the disclosure of the Lieutenant Governor's letter in the financial media on May 28, 2025, Sable Offshore’s stock price fell more than 15%, as the market realized the company's statements were not accurate.\n\nFurther Judicial Intervention and Stock Drop\n\nThe lawsuit further alleges that the company's legal troubles deepened on June 4, 2025, when Sable Offshore disclosed that a Santa Barbara County Superior Court judge had issued a temporary restraining order. This order prohibited the company from restarting oil transportation through the Las Flores Pipeline System, pending a hearing on a preliminary injunction. This news reportedly caused the stock to fall even further.\n\nThe litigation seeks to hold the company and its underwriters accountable for allegedly raising capital under false pretenses, causing significant losses for investors.\n\nHagens Berman’s Investigation\n\nHagens Berman is investigating these claims on behalf of investors who have suffered substantial losses.\n\nReed Kathrein, the Hagens Berman partner leading the investigation, commented on the situation, “Our investigation is centered on whether the company’s public statements accurately reflected the on-the-ground reality of its operations.”\n\nIf you invested in Sable and have substantial losses, or have knowledge that may assist the firm’s investigation, submit your losses now »\n\nIf you’d like more information and answers to frequently asked questions about the Sable case and our investigation, read more »\n\nWhistleblowers: Persons with non-public information regarding Sable Offshore should consider their options to help in the investigation or take advantage of the SEC Whistleblower program.

            "content": "NEW YORK, Aug.  26, 2025  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Bragar Eagel & Squire, P.C., a nationally recognized shareholder rights law firm, reminds investors that class actions have been commenced on behalf of stockholders of Flywire Corporation (NASDAQ:FLYW), Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT), Lineage, Inc. (NASDAQ:LINE) and Sable Offshore Corporation (NYSE:SOC). Stockholders have until the deadlines below to petition the court to serve as lead plaintiff. Additional information about each case can be found at the link provided.\n\nFlywire Corporation (NASDAQ:FLYW)\n\nClass Period: February 28, 2024 to February 25, 2025\n\nLead Plaintiff Deadline: September 23, 2025\n\nAccording to the complaint, during the class period, defendants failed to disclose that (i) the strength and sustainability of Flywire’s revenue growth was overstated, and (ii) the negative impact that permit- and visa-related restrictions were having and were likely to have on Flywire’s business was understated.\n\nOn February 25, 2025, Flywire issued a press release announcing disappointing fourth quarter and FY 2024 financial results. The same day, during a conference call, the Company revealed it expected “revenue in both [Canadian and Australian] markets to be down over 30% [Y/Y]” because of “recent policy changes” and “new visa rules [that] are starting to affect demand[,]” while also citing headwinds in the Company’s U.S. market on similarly shifting visa trends. On this news, multiple analysts downgraded their recommendation on Flywire and/or cut their price target. Following the disclosures and analyst downgrades and PT cuts, Flywire’s voting common stock price fell $6.59 per share, or 37.36%, to close at $11.05 per share on February 26, 2025.\n\nFor more information on the Flywire lawsuit go to: https://bespc.com/cases/FLYW\n\nLockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT)\n\nClass Period: January 23, 2024 to July 21, 2025\n\nLead Plaintiff Deadline: September 26, 2025\n\nThe complaint filed in this class action alleges that throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and/or misleading statements, as well as failed to disclose material adverse facts about the Company's business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, Defendants failed to disclose to investors: (1) that Lockheed Martin lacked effective internal controls regarding its purportedly risk adjusted contracts including the reporting of its risk adjusted profit booking rate; (2) that Lockheed Martin lacked effective procedures to perform reasonably accurate comprehensive reviews of program requirements, technical complexities, schedule, and risks; (3) that Lockheed Martin overstated its ability to deliver on its contract commitments in terms of cost, quality and schedule; (4) that, as a result, the Company was reasonably likely to report significant losses; and (5) that, as a result of the foregoing, Defendants' positive statements about the Company's business, operations, and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis.\n\nOn October 22, 2024, before the market opened, Lockheed Martin announced it was forced to recognize losses of $80 million on a classified program at the Company's Aeronautics business segment \"due to higher than anticipated costs to achieve program objectives.\" The Company also announced it had recognized a reach-forward loss in its Rotary and Mission Systems segment \"as a result of additional quantity ordering risk identified on fixed-price options.\"\n\nOn this news, the Company's share price fell $37.63 or 6.12% to close at $576.98 on October 22, 2024, on unusually heavy trading volume.\n\nThen, on January 28, 2025, before the market opened, Lockheed Martin announced it was forced to record pre-tax losses of $1.7 billion associated with classified programs at its Aeronautics and Missiles and Fire Control business. The Company explained \"as a result of performance trends\" and \"in contemplation of near-term program milestones,\" it had \"performed a comprehensive review of the prgram requirements, technical complexities, schedule, and risks\" based on which it recognized $555 million of losses in its Aeronautics program. The Company further reported additional losses of approximately $1.3 billion in its Missiles and Fire Control business due to, among other things, the \"future requirements of the program, discussions with the customer and suppliers.\" As a result, the Company's net earnings in 2024 were $5.3 billion, or $22.31 per share, compared to $6.9 billion, or $27.55 per share, in 2023.\n\nOn this news, the Company's share price fell $46.24 or 9.2% to close at $457.45 on January 28, 2025 on unusually heavy trading volume.\n\nThen, on July 22, 2025, before the market opened, Lockheed Martin disclosed it was forced to record an additional $1.6 billion in pre-tax losses on classified programs, including $950 million in losses related to its Aeronautics Classified program due to \"design, integration, and test challenges, as well as other performance issues.\" The Company also recorded $570 million in losses on its Canadian Maritime Helicopter Program due in part to providing \"additional mission capabilities, enhanced logistical support, fleet life extension, and revised expectations regarding flight hours.\" The Company further recorded a $95 million charge related to its Turkish Utility Helicopter Program due to the \"current status of the program.\" As a result, the Company reported sharply lower net earnings of $342 million, or $1.46 per share, including $1.6 billion of program losses and $169 million of other charges.\n\nOn this news, the Company's share price fell $49.79 or 10.8%, to close at $410.74 on July 22, 2025, on unusually heavy trading volume.\n\nFor more information on the Lockheed Martin lawsuit go to: https://bespc.com/cases/LMT\n\nSable Offshore Corporation (NYSE:SOC)\n\nClass Period: May 19, 2025 to June 3, 2025\n\nLead Plaintiff Deadline: September 26, 2025\n\nAccording to the Sable Offshore class action lawsuit, on or about May 21, 2025, Sable Offshore conducted its SPO, issuing 10 million shares of its common stock at the offering price of $29.50 per share for proceeds of $295 million to Sable Offshore. The Sable Offshore class action lawsuit alleges that defendants throughout the Class Period and in the SPO's offering documents represented that Sable Offshore had restarted oil production off the coast of California when it had not.\n\nThe Sable Offshore class action lawsuit further alleges that on May 23, 2025, Eleni Kounalakis, the Lieutenant Governor of California and chair of the California State Lands Commission wrote a letter to Sable Offshore's Vice President of Environmental & Government Affairs, Steve Rusch, stating that a May 19, 2025 Sable Offshore press release \"appears to mischaracterize the nature of recent activities, causing significant public confusion and raising questions regarding Sable's intentions. Your press release also implies that Sable has restarted operations at the Santa Ynez Unit (SYU). However, Commission staff has informed me that the limited volume oil flows are the result of well-testing procedures required by the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement prior to restart. These activities do not constitute a resumption of commercial production or a full restart of the SYU.\" The May 23 letter was not published on the internet for the general public to view until May 28, 2025, the complaint alleges. On this news, the price of Sable Offshore stock fell more than 15%, according to the Sable Offshore class action lawsuit.\n\nThen, on June 4, 2025, the complaint alleges that Sable Offshore revealed that \"[o]n June 3, 2025, a Santa Barbara County Superior Court Judge granted ex parte requests from plaintiffs in Center for Biological Diversity, et al. v. California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, et al. (25CV02244) and Environmental Defense Center, et al. v. California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, et al. (25CV02247) for temporary restraining orders prohibiting Sable Offshore Corp. ('Sable') from restarting transportation of oil through the Las Flores Pipeline System pending the hearing on an order to show cause regarding a preliminary injunction scheduled for July 18, 2025.\" On this news, the price of Sable Offshore stock fell further, according to the Sable Offshore class action lawsuit.\n\nFor more information on the Sable Offshore lawsuit go to: https://bespc.com/cases/SOC\n\nLineage, Inc. (NASDAQ:LINE)\n\nLead Plaintiff Deadline: September 30, 2025\n\nOn June 26, 2024, Lineage filed a registration statement for the IPO on Form S-11 with the SEC which, after amendments, was declared effective on July 24, 2024 (the \"Registration Statement\").\n\nOn July 26, 2024, Lineage filed a prospectus for the IPO on Form 424B4 with the SEC, which was incorporated into and formed part of the Registration Statement.\n\nThe complaint alleges that the Registration Statement contained material misrepresentations about Lineage's business, historical financial results, and the industry trends purportedly facing the Company at the time of the IPO. Specifically, the Registration Statement stated that the lingering effects of the COVID-19 pandemic had \"accelerated trends that had a marked short-term impact on cold storage demand and have the potential to be growth engines for the industry in coming years\" after the IPO. In truth, Lineage was in the midst of a sustained downturn, as the Company's customers not only destocked excessive inventory built up during the COVID-19 pandemic, but also shifted to the maintenance of leaner inventories on a go-forward basis and as more cold-storage supply came on line, with Lineage suffering particularly negative effects in terms of occupancy rates and pricing power due to its recent imposition of unsustainable price increases amongst its customer base.\n\nSince the IPO approximately one year ago, the price of Lineage stock has fallen to lows near $40 per share - approximately half the IPO price.\n\nFor more information on the Lineage lawsuit go to: https://bespc.com/cases/LINE\n\nAbout Bragar Eagel & Squire, P.C.:\n\nBragar Eagel & Squire, P.C. is a nationally recognized law firm with offices in New York, California, and South Carolina.

Reference actual numbers in your reasoning.\n\n3. **Consistency**: Apply the same scoring standards regardless of the stock. A score of 85 should represent the same quality level across all analyses.\n\n4. **Risk Focus**: Pay special attention to red flags that could invalidate the opportunity (poor liquidity, imminent earnings, deteriorating fundamentals).\n\n5. **Strategy Alignment**: Consider how well this opportunity fits options strategies (directional bias, volatility conditions, time decay considerations).\n\n6. **Completeness Check**: If critical data is missing, note it in your analysis but don't penalize the opportunity excessively for data gaps.\n\nAnalyze the SOC opportunity now using this framework and respond with the required JSON format.",

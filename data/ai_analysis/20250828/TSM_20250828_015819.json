            "content": "Investing.com -- Shares of major semiconductor firms fell Wednesday after-hours when Nvidia Corp.’s closely watched quarterly results failed to fully satisfy lofty investor expectations, igniting concerns across the high-flying AI chip sector. Despite earnings topping Wall Street estimates, a slight shortfall in data center revenue weighed on sentiment.\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices Inc. dropped 1.6%, Micron Technology Inc. fell 1.1%, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing shed 0.8%, Broadcom Inc. declined 0.9%, and Intel Corp. slipped 0.3%. The sector-wide reversal came as Nvidia’s report underscored rising challenges facing AI chipmakers, particularly amid ongoing U.S.-China trade restrictions.\n\nNvidia’s stock fell about 2% in after-hours trading after reporting fiscal first-quarter adjusted earnings of $1.04 per share on $46.7 billion in revenue, beating consensus forecasts of $1.01 and $46.1 billion. However, data center revenue,its largest and most critical division, came in at $41.1 billion, missing analysts’ projection of $41.34 billion.\n\nInvestors have come to view Nvidia as a bellwether for the generative AI boom, with its chips powering many leading AI applications. The slight shortfall in the data center segment raised questions about whether growth in the AI sector is peaking or merely facing geopolitical headwinds.\n\nThe company acknowledged that U.S. restrictions on its H20 chip sales to China, a significant market, have impacted revenues. While Nvidia’s forecast for fiscal Q2 revenue of $54 billion exceeded expectations of $52.76 billion, it excludes any contribution from those China-bound chips.\n\nWith AI valuations stretched and expectations high, any deviation from perfection can spark a swift market reaction. Investors are awaiting further commentary from Nvidia’s earnings call to get clarity on margins, demand pipelines, and geopolitical risk assessments.\n\nTraders appeared eager to reevaluate broader chip sector positioning as volatility returned to semiconductor names. The disappointment in Nvidia’s data center unit, despite the strong headline results, highlights increasing scrutiny over the AI-led rally’s sustainability.\n\nAs the AI chip landscape evolves, market reaction underscores how priced-in future growth already is to semis. A narrow revenue miss from the industry’s leading player is enough to send shockwaves through the broader sector.\n\nRelated articles\n\nChip stocks fall with Nvidia after data center rev disappointment\n\nThese Under-the-Radar Stocks Offer Better Risk-Reward Ratio Than Nvidia\n\nAfter soaring 149%, this stock is back in our AI’s favor - & already +25% in July\n\nView Comments",

As of today's call, it has doubled to 28%. This includes the additional 30% China tariffs, 50% India tariff, 20% via non-tariff and averaged 18% tariff on the rest of the world as well as the 50% steel and aluminum tariffs and a 50% copper tariff.\"\n\nThe furniture company, which houses brands such as West Elm and Pottery Barn, reported better-than-expected earnings of $2.00 per share. Wall Street expected EPS of $1.80.\n\nWilliams-Sonoma stock was down 1.4% in early afternoon trading. The stock sank earlier this week, along with other furniture stocks, after President Trump posted on social media that his administration would open an investigation into furniture imports and impose additional tariffs on the sector.\n\n\"It's early to speculate — I think we're day 5 of a 50-day probe, there's not a lot of information on this subject,\" Laura Alber, Williams-Sonoma's CEO, said about possible furniture tariffs. \"But I will say that it's going to be very difficult for the industry, even if tariffs are put on to bring a huge amount back to the United States in a short window of time, because there aren't the factories available to do a lot of production.\"\n\n\"For us, of course, we will be in a much better position than most if that were to happen because of our strong USA manufacturing capabilities already,\" Alber continued. \"We have ...

Smucker Company posted weaker-than-expected earnings as higher commodity costs and consumers pulling back on buying weighed on profits. The stock fell as much as 5% in premarket trading.\n\nThe company's profits fell 22% to $1.90 per share, below estimates for $1.93 per share, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence. Net sales declined 1% to $2.1 billion due to divestitures and unfavorable foreign currency exchange but were roughly in line with estimates.\n\nCoffee sales increased 15% but profits fell 22% due to higher commodity prices and marketing costs. Meanwhile, Net sales declined for peanut butter, but were partially offset by higher pricing for Uncrustables frozen sandwiches.\n\nThe company raised its net sales guidance for the full year to 3% to 5% and kept its earnings per share guidance the same ($8.50-$9.50).

Adjusted earnings per share came in at $2.32, slightly above expectations.\n\nNet sales increased 3% year over year, though Hollister was the sales engine. Hollister's comparable net sales jumped 19% year over year, while Abercrombie's fell 11%.\n\nThe retailer raised its full-year net sales guidance to 5% to 7% from 3% to 6% previously and also increased its earnings per share forecast by $0.50 on the low end to a range of $10.00 to $10.50.

Reference actual numbers in your reasoning.\n\n3. **Consistency**: Apply the same scoring standards regardless of the stock. A score of 85 should represent the same quality level across all analyses.\n\n4. **Risk Focus**: Pay special attention to red flags that could invalidate the opportunity (poor liquidity, imminent earnings, deteriorating fundamentals).\n\n5. **Strategy Alignment**: Consider how well this opportunity fits options strategies (directional bias, volatility conditions, time decay considerations).\n\n6. **Completeness Check**: If critical data is missing, note it in your analysis but don't penalize the opportunity excessively for data gaps.\n\nAnalyze the TSM opportunity now using this framework and respond with the required JSON format.",

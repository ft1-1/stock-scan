            "title": "Lam Research Stock Trades at Low P/E: Should You Buy, Sell or Hold?",
            "content": "Lam Research Corporation LRCX, a leader in semiconductor fabrication equipment, currently trades at a forward 12-month price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 22.32, significantly lower than the Zacks Electronics – Semiconductors industry average of 32.9.\n\nForward 12-Month P/E MultipleZacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nLRCX’s P/E multiple is also lower than some other semiconductor fabrication equipment providers, including KLA Corporation KLAC 25.17, ASML Holding ASML 26.39 and Applied Optoelectronics, Inc. AAOI. At present, KLA Corporation, ASML Holding and Applied Optoelectronics have a forward 12-month P/E ratio of 25.17, 26.39 and 39.33, respectively.\n\nThis relatively lower valuation suggests that Lam Research stock could be undervalued, particularly considering its growth potential in artificial intelligence (AI) and high-performance computing (HPC) markets.\n\nAdditionally, Lam Research trades at a discounted P/E multiple despite the stock having a tremendous run this year so far. LRCX shares have soared 37.3% year to date (YTD), outperforming the industry’s gain of 14.6%. Compared with rivals, it has outpaced ASML Holding and Applied Optoelectronics while underperforming KLA Corporation.\n\nYTD Price Return PerformanceZacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nThis share price outperformance and a low valuation multiple raise the question: Should investors buy, sell or hold LRCX stock?\n\nAI and Data Center Trends Drive LRCX’s Growth Story\n\nLam Research is benefiting from powerful shifts in semiconductor demand, particularly around artificial intelligence (AI) and data center chips. These advanced chips require complex manufacturing, and Lam Research provides the essential tools, like deposition and etching systems, needed to build them.\n\nIn 2024, Lam Research’s shipments for gate-all-around nodes and advanced packaging exceeded $1 billion, and management expects this figure to triple to more than $3 billion in 2025. Additionally, the industry’s migration to backside power distribution and dry-resist processing presents growth opportunities for LRCX’s cutting-edge fabrication solutions.\n\nThese trends are aiding Lam Research’s financial performance. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025, the company reported revenues of $5.17 billion, up 34% year over year, and non-GAAP EPS of $1.33, highlighting a 64% increase.\n\nLam Research Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseLam Research Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise\n\nLam Research Corporation price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Lam Research Corporation Quote\n\nExpanding its manufacturing operations in Asia has also helped the company lower costs and improve margins. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025, Lam Research’s non-GAAP operating margin rose to 34.4%, up 370 basis points from last year, which is impressive, considering the challenging macroeconomic environment.\n\nStory Continues\n\nNear-Term Challenges Persist for Lam Research\n\nWhile Lam Research’s long-term growth outlook remains strong, several near-term challenges warrant caution. One of the primary concerns is the potential for escalating U.S.-China trade tensions, which could impact its sales in China, a market that represents a significant portion of its revenues.\n\nIn fiscal 2025, approximately 34% of Lam Research’s revenues were generated in China, a sharp decline from 42% in fiscal 2025. Given the ongoing restrictions on technology exports to China, LRCX faces heightened risk, creating increased uncertainty and lower visibility in the near term.\n\nThe semiconductor market’s cyclical nature poses a risk to Lam Research’s revenue consistency. NAND pricing pressures and the cautious capital spending among memory and logic clients could limit growth in the near term.\n\nLam Research’s extensive reliance on these segments makes it vulnerable to cyclical downturns. However, as memory spending is projected to rebound by late 2025, the company may weather this period of reduced spending, but the short-term outlook remains uncertain.\n\nConclusion: Hold Lam Research Stock for Now\n\nLam Research’s attractive valuation, strong technological foundation and strategic focus on high-growth markets like AI and HPC make it a compelling long-term investment. While near-term headwinds such as geopolitical risks and cyclical pressures remain, the company’s innovation and operational efficiency provide a solid foundation for future growth. Considering these factors, holding LRCX stock appears to be the most prudent strategy for investors.\n\nLam Research carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) at present.

            "content": "Key Points\n\nApplied Optoelectronics' stock is up 178% over the past year but still down 50% from its yearly high. Manufacturing in America and Taiwan helps the company avoid most tariff risks. Share dilution has increased sharply, but the stock price has also soared (and dipped, and soared again). 10 stocks we like better than Applied Optoelectronics ›\n\nI know, I know. Applied Optoelectronics(NASDAQ: AAOI) isn't exactly down in the dumps. As of Aug. 15, 2025, it has gained 178% over the last 52 weeks.\n\nBut Applied Optoelectronics earned its price gains the hard and honest way: by selling high-performance optical networking products into several hungry target markets. And despite the impressive one-year return, the stock has dropped 50% from December's multiyear highs.\n\nHere's why I think you should consider buying Applied Optoelectronics' stock in this strange blend of soaring gains and sullen dips.\n\nBooming data center and CATV sales\n\nIn the recent second-quarter report, Applied Optoelectronics saw fantastic growth in its two largest divisions. With the artificial intelligence (AI) market driving strong demand for the company's fastest networking modules, data center sales rose 30% year over year to $44.8 million. Cable TV (CATV) sales soared from $5.8 million to $56.0 million, as an unnamed mega-customer invested in fiber-optic network infrastructure.\n\nThese results included the company's first shipment of 400-gigabit data center transceivers to a tech giant that hadn't been buying Applied Optoelectronics products for several years. Looking ahead, several large customers are testing the as-yet-unreleased 800-gigabit products. Shipments should start before the end of 2025, with the exact timing depending on factory upgrades and customers' qualification testing.\n\nDodging tariffs with smart manufacturing\n\nApplied Optoelectronics also has enough international manufacturing scale to dodge most of the looming tariff costs. Its laser chips have been made in America for years, and next-generation network transceivers will be made in Texas and Taiwan. The most expensive tariff categories are hardly a concern at all, according to earnings-call commentary by CFO Stefan Murry:\n\nIn our 800G and 1.6T transceiver designs, less than 10% of the value of the components used is currently sourced from China, and we have a pathway as we scale production to further reduce this China content, ultimately to near zero. We also are in discussion with several key suppliers about onshoring their production to the US to support a robust domestic supply chain.\n\nStory Continues\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nCan you stomach these investor risks?\n\nBesides AI and CATV networking, Applied Optoelectronics also makes laser-based sensors and network controller chips. It's an exciting company at the nexus of many promising growth markets.\n\nThat being said, it's not a flawless success story. I can see how two issues might keep you from buying Applied Optoelectronics stock.\n\nThe company's financial results are a bit jumpy, as a large chunk of its revenue generation comes from very large orders from a handful of key customers. That's a deal-breaker for investors who prefer a predictable business with smooth revenue streams. However, the bumpy road should calm down over time as Applied Optoelectronics expands its client roster. Applied Optoelectronics is in the habit of printing new shares, largely to support its stock-based compensation program. The share count has increased by a whopping 125% in the last three years. But this dilution took place in a period of impressive stock returns. It's hard to complain about heavy dilution when the stock price still soared 1,340% higher.\n\nThere will be surprises on the road ahead, and not all of them will be pleasant. I'm still impressed by Applied Optoelectronics' disciplined innovation and market-leading performance boosters. Its focus on American manufacturing should also be helpful in this era of international trade tension.\n\nThe AI boom is here to stay, and high-speed networking isn't going out of style any time soon. If you can focus on Applied Optoelectronics' business growth and overcome these potential downsides, I think the stock should serve you well over the next few years.\n\nShould you buy stock in Applied Optoelectronics right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Applied Optoelectronics, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Applied Optoelectronics wasn’t one of them.

            "content": "The Walt Disney Company(NYSE: DIS) was founded in 1923 but didn't go public until 1957 when it joined the New York Stock Exchange at a share price of $13.88. The company's stock has risen 4,500% since then, alongside consistent earnings growth.\n\nHowever, recent years haven't been kind to the entertainment giant.\n\nData by YCharts.\n\nThe above chart shows how Disney's stock mostly trended up normally until the pandemic hit in 2020, when park and theater closures shuttered large parts of its business. The company enjoyed a short-lived rally in 2021 as investors banded around its recently launched streaming expansion. However, Disney's share price has plunged 50% since peaking in the spring of 2021.\n\nPandemic headwinds combined with an expensive venture into streaming led to investor pullback -- a situation that has taken Disney years to come back from. However, recent earnings suggest there's finally light at the end of the tunnel and a recovery is underway.\n\nAs a result, Disney's stock appears to be a bargain after major declines. So it's become a growth stock down 50% to buy right now.\n\nOn a more stable growth trajectory than its rivals\n\nDisney posted its third-quarter 2024 earnings on Aug. 7. Revenue increased by 4% year over year to $23 billion, outperforming Wall Street estimates by $70 million. Meanwhile, earnings per share of $1.39 beat by $0.20. The period also delivered impressive gains in operating income, which rose 19% year over year to more than $4 billion.\n\nA profit boost was mainly due to growth in Disney's entertainment segment, which saw operating income nearly triple after a major win in streaming. In Q3 2024, the company's streaming business, which includes income from Disney+, ESPN+, and Hulu, hit profitability for the first time -- a quarter earlier than expected.\n\nData by YCharts.\n\nStreaming is a notoriously challenging and costly industry to break into. The chart above compares the earnings growth of some of the top entertainment companies. Warner Bros. Discovery and Comcast have delivered significantly less financial growth over the last year than Disney. While many factors are at play here, it's relatively widely known these organizations have faced repeated headwinds expanding into streaming.\n\nMeanwhile, Disney's solid recovery following a global pandemic and subsequent economic downturn illustrates its staying power and ability to navigate poor market conditions successfully. A recent win in streaming also proves the potency of the Disney brand, as it's been able to retain subscribers.\n\nDisney stock is a bargain compared to its potential\n\nDisney has enjoyed many wins this year. In addition to turning a profit in streaming, the company is the only film studio to make more than $1 billion at the box office in 2024. And Disney has done it twice -- with Inside Out 2, released in June, and Deadpool & Wolverine, which debuted in July.\n\nThe success of this year's Deadpool threequel has reinvigorated interest in Disney's Marvel Cinematic Universe, which had grown stale with audiences after a string of low-performing entries. However, the box-office darling has bolstered hype for new Marvel titles coming in 2025, including the Daredevil: Born Again series for Disney+ and The Fantastic 4: First Steps film, which will be released next July.\n\nRecent quarterly earnings and an exciting content roadmap have put Disney on a promising growth path. Q3 2024 saw some slowdown in the company's parks division, with experiences operating income of $2 billion, down 3% from the previous year.\n\nHowever, park earnings often ebb and flow with the economy and consumer spending power, which has faced uncertainty in recent years. Streaming growth remains a solid reason to invest in Disney, diversifying its business and allowing it to lean less on parks.\n\nData by YCharts.\n\nMoreover, this chart shows Disney's stock is potentially trading at its best value in years, with its price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) and price-to-sales ratio (P/S) below their five-year averages.\n\nRepeated hits to Disney's business since 2019 inflated its P/E and P/S at times. However, positive quarterly results and a sell-off in recent years have made Disney's current position a bargain compared to its potential. The company is in recovery mode, making now an excellent time to buy the dip on this well-known growth stock.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Walt Disney right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Walt Disney, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Walt Disney wasn’t one of them.

(NASDAQ:AVGO) with a $315 price target, citing the company’s momentum in artificial intelligence. He expects Q3 FY 2025 earnings to exceed consensus, driven by strong demand for AI-related services from major customers, including Google and Meta. AI sales are projected to represent nearly 30% of Broadcom’s fiscal 2025 revenue.Citi Reiterates Buy on Broadcom (AVGO) Amid AI, Wireless Market Optimism\n\nDanely acknowledged concerns about potential margin pressure from AI, but noted that recovery in Broadcom Inc.’s (NASDAQ:AVGO) non-AI semiconductor business could offset those risks. Reflecting this view, he has raised revenue and earnings forecasts for the coming years. Broadcom’s expansion into wireless and other markets is also seen as providing additional growth avenues.\n\nEarlier in July, Danely had already increased his price target to $315 from $285 in a Q2 preview, arguing that sector concerns over tariffs had not materialized. He anticipated a cyclical upturn driven by demand recovery and inventory restocking, which would further support his bullish stance on Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO).\n\nBroadcom Inc.

            "content": "The S&P 500 Index ($SPX) (SPY) on Thursday closed up by +0.32%, the Dow Jones Industrials Index ($DOWI) (DIA) closed up by +0.16%, and the Nasdaq 100 Index ($IUXX) (QQQ) closed up by +0.58%.  September E-mini S&P futures (ESU25) rose +0.32%, and September E-mini Nasdaq futures (NQU25) rose +0.56%.\n\nStock indexes rallied on Thursday, with the S&P 500 posting a new all-time high and the Nasdaq 100 posting a 1.5-week high.  Signs that the US economy is holding up pushed stock prices higher on Thursday after Q2 GDP was revised higher than expected, showing the economy expanded more than initially estimated.  Also, US weekly initial unemployment claims fell as expected, easing concerns about the labor market.  Strength in software stocks and chip makers led the overall market higher on Thursday.Join 200K+ Subscribers: Find out why the midday Barchart Brief newsletter is a must-read for thousands daily.\n\nLimiting gains in stocks on Thursday was some disappointing earnings news.  Hormel Foods fell more than -13% after reporting weaker-than-expected Q3 adjusted EPS and forecasting Q4 adjusted EPS below consensus.  Additionally, there's some weakness in AI stocks following Nvidia's sales forecast, which fell short of lofty expectations.  Nvidia fell -0.79% after reporting weaker-than-expected Q2 data center revenue and giving a revenue forecast that was seen as underwhelming.\n\nUS Q2 GDP was revised upward to +3.3% (q/q annualized) from the previously reported +3.0%, stronger than expectations of +3.1%.\n\nUS weekly initial unemployment claims fell -5,000 to 229,000, close to expectations of 230,000.\n\nUS Jul pending home sales fell -0.4% m/m, weaker than expectations of -0.2% m/m.\n\nRegarding tariffs, President Trump late Monday threatened to impose new tariffs and export restrictions on advanced technology and semiconductors in retaliation against other nations' digital services taxes that hit American companies.  Last week, Mr. Trump widened steel and aluminum tariffs to include more than 400 consumer items that contain the metals, such as motorcycles, auto parts, furniture components, and tableware.  The change went into effect last Monday and did not exclude goods already in transit.\n\nIn other recent tariff news, Mr. Trump on August 13 extended the tariff truce with China for another 90 days until November.  On August 6, Mr. Trump announced that he will double tariffs on US imports from India to 50% from the current 25% tariff, due to India's purchases of Russian oil.  According to Bloomberg Economics, the average US tariff will rise to 15.2% if rates are implemented as announced, up from 13.3% earlier, and significantly higher than the 2.3% in 2024 before the tariffs were announced.\n\nThe markets this week are focusing on any fresh tariff news or developments on ending the Ukraine-Russian war.  On Friday, July personal spending is expected to climb +0.3% m/m, and July personal income is expected to rise +0.4% m/m.   Also, the July core PCE price index, the Fed's preferred inflation gauge, is expected to climb +0.2% m/m and +2.9% y/y.  In addition, the Aug MNI Chicago PMI is expected to fall -0.6 to 46.5.  Finally, the University of Michigan's final-Aug US consumer sentiment index is expected to be unrevised at 58.6.\n\nFederal funds futures prices are discounting the chances for a -25 bp rate cut at 86% at the next FOMC meeting on September 16-17.  The markets are discounting the chances at 53% for a second -25 bp rate cut at the following meeting on October 28-29.\n\nEarnings reports indicate that S&P 500 earnings for Q2 are on track to rise +9.1% y/y, much better than the pre-season expectations of +2.8% y/y and the most in four years, according to Bloomberg Intelligence.  With Q2 earnings season winding down, over 95% of S&P 500 firms having reported Q2 earnings, about 82% of companies exceeded profit estimates.\n\nOverseas stock markets on Thursday settled higher.  The Euro Stoxx 50 closed up +0.07%.  China's Shanghai Composite closed up +1.14%.  Japan's Nikkei Stock 225 closed up +0.73%.\n\nInterest Rates\n\nSeptember 10-year T-notes (ZNU5) on Thursday closed up +4 ticks, and the 10-year T-note yield fell -2.3 bp to 4.209%.\n\nSep T-notes climbed to a 4-month nearest-futures high on Thursday, and the 10-year T-note yield fell to a 2-week low of 4.201%.  T-notes moved higher on Thursday, benefiting from positive carryover from Wednesday, when New York Fed President Williams stated that at some point, it will be appropriate for the Fed to move rates down, as it is still in a \"modestly restrictive\" stance on policy.\n\nGains in T-notes are limited after the US Q2 GDP was revised higher than expected and after weekly jobless claims declined as expected, which are hawkish factors for Fed policy.  Also, weak demand for the Treasury's $44 billion auction of 7-year T-notes was bearish for T-note prices as the auction had a bid-to-cover ratio of 2.49, weaker than the 10-auction average of 2.66.\n\nEuropean government bond yields on Thursday moved lower.  The 10-year German bund yield fell to a 2-week low of 2.679% and finished down -0.5 bp to 2.695%.  10-year UK gilt yield fell -3.6 bp to 4.699%.\n\nThe Eurozone's August economic confidence indicator unexpectedly fell -0.5 to 95.2, weaker than expectations of an increase to 96.0.\n\nEurozone July new car registrations rose 7.4% year-over-year to 914,680, the biggest increase in 15 months.\n\nThe summary of the July 23-24 ECB meeting showed that policymakers deemed the risks to inflation to be \"broadly balanced\" and that the Eurozone economy has so far remained resilient to headwinds ranging from tariffs to wars.\n\nSwaps are discounting the chances at 3% for a -25 bp rate cut by the ECB at the September 11 policy meeting.\n\nUS Stock Movers\n\nChipmakers rallied on Thursday to provide support to the broader market.  Marvell Technology (MRVL) closed up more than +4%, and Micron Technology (MU) and Broadcom (AVGO) closed up more than +3%.  Also, Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), Applied Materials (AMAT), and NXP Semiconductors NV (NXPI) closed up more than +1%.\n\nSnowflake (SNOW) closed up more than +18% to lead software stocks higher after reporting Q2 product revenue of $1.09 billion, better than the

He also maintained his equivalent of a buy recommendation.10 stocks we like better than Broadcom ›\n\nHardly for the first time in this \"year of the chip stock\" on the back of eager artificial intelligence (AI) adoption, Broadcom(NASDAQ: AVGO) was the subject of an analyst's price target raise on Thursday. This was compounded by the disappointment about a peer company's recent performance, resulting in some investors fleeing to Broadcom.\n\nUltimately, Broadcom stock closed Thursday's trading session nearly 3% higher, easily trouncing the S&P 500 index's 0.3% increase.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now. Learn More »\n\nA $20 change\n\nThursday's Broadcom booster was Oppenheimer's Rick Schafer, who upped his fair value assessment on the company to $325 per share. That was a bit of distance up from his preceding $305. In making that change he maintained his outperform (buy, in other words) recommendation on the shares.\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nIt's no coincidence that Schafer's updated take came one week before the company is scheduled to post its third-quarter results. His new analysis addressed both that quarter and the following frame, according to reports, with Schafer predicting that both will be impressive given the monster appetite for artificial intelligence (AI) solutions.\n\nOne of Broadcom's major appeals these days is its expertise in application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs), essentially custom chips for advanced functionalities like AI. Schafer pointed out that the company is a leader in this product category.\n\nLooking good next to the big peer\n\nOn Thursday, Broadcom also benefited from the fact that it is not Nvidia. The chip giant stumbled that day, tripped up by a second quarter of fiscal 2026 earnings report that left many investors disappointed.

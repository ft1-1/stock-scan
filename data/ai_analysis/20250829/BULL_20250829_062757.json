This month's relaunch brings 24/7 crypto trading back into Webull’s main app (Webull Pay), supporting over 50 digital assets [https://seekingalpha.com/news/4488708-webull-relaunches-crypto-trading-for-us-customers-on-monday---report], from Bitcoin (BTCUSD) [https://www.barchart.com/quotes/^BTCUSD] and Ethereum (ETHUSD) [https://www.barchart.com/quotes/^ETHUSD] to Solana (SOLUSD) [https://www.barchart.com/quotes/^SOLUSD], directly alongside stocks and options. For Webull’s over 24 million users, this means seamless access to crypto markets on the same platform. The move follows a successful trial in Brazil and company restructuring, and analysts expect it to boost trading volume by around 30% post-launch.\n\nIn short, Webull’s comeback signals renewed retail access to crypto and a more integrated trading experience. For investors, this move raises a pressing question: as Webull doubles down on crypto, is BULL stock worth buying today?\n\nABOUT BULL STOCK\n\nHeadquartered in Saint Petersburg, Florida, Webull is a global digital investment platform that gives retail investors access to securities trading through its licensed broker-dealer. The company recently went public on April 11, a move that has accelerated its growth and drawn increased attention from investors. \n\nValued at a small market cap of $7 billion, this new IPO company's shares slid 9% this month but remain about 23% higher year-to-date. [https://www.barchart.com/stocks/quotes/BULL/performance] The stock trades 40% up from its 52-week low of $10.18.\n\nIn terms of valuation, Webull trades at a 5x sales ratio, which is 55% higher than the sector median of 3.2x, indicating that investors are pricing in stronger growth expectations and a premium for its expanding user base and potential in crypto-driven revenues.\n www.barchart.com [https://www.barchart.com/stocks/quotes/BULL/interactive-chart] \n\nEARNINGS SPOTLIGHT: Q2 RESULTS ON DECK\n\nWebull will release its second-quarter results after the market closes on Thursday, and investors are watching closely. The company has drawn attention with the relaunch of its cryptocurrency trading platform, a move that could play a big role in shaping near-term sentiment.\n\nIn Q1, Webull posted revenue of $117.37 million [https://www.webull.com/news/12860855480435712#:~:text=Q1%20Results%3A%20Webull%20reported%20first,of%20six%20cents%20per%20share.], up 32% year-over-year (YoY), while reporting a loss of $0.06 per share. Customer assets climbed 45%, and registered users rose 17% to 24.1 million, showing steady growth across its platform.\n\nThe balance sheet looks supportive. Cash and cash equivalents stood at about $297.5 million (plus materially large customer-segregated balances). Management did not issue formal revenue or EPS guidance for Q2 or the full fiscal year, and published analyst consensus figures remain scarce ahead of the Q2 release. Some market observers have crudely annualized Q1 to suggest a FY topline in the $470 million to $550 million range if growth sustains.\n\nThe big focus now shifts to how Webull’s push into crypto impacts its topline. The firm reintroduced digital asset trading in Brazil during June and expanded it again this week to the U.S., giving customers access to more than 50 cryptos. \n\nWHAT DOES WEBULL CRYPTO MOVE MEAN FOR INVESTORS\n\nThe relaunch of crypto trading on Webull's platform is providing traders with additional venues in which they can leap into Bitcoin. That said, this does not mean you have to automatically pour money into BULL. As Bitcoin prices rise, your bank account will increase your gains; however, when the market retreats, it will also add to the losses. Fund rebalancing and volatility drag may eat up your investment in turbulent markets. Glitches in technology or regulatory changes could be the reason the price stubbornly nudges as well.\n\nBULL is attractive here for traders seeking short-term exposure, not for investors looking for longer-term, buy-and-hold positions. This means you should only think of BULL as a strategy game. Consider your position sizing, stop-loss strategies, and practice risk management. Continue to do your own research on Webull and respond to company news appropriately.\n\n_ On the date of publication, Nauman Khan [https://www.barchart.com/news/authors/413/nauman-khan] did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

Previously, US users needed to open and access a separate Webull Pay account through a dedicated app to trade cryptocurrencies.\n\n\"By reintegrating crypto trading into the Webull app, we are making it easier for customers to access and manage their entire portfolio, whether they’re trading stocks, options, or digital assets,\" said Anthony Denier, US CEO and Group President at Webull.\n\nStephen Yip, CEO of Webull Pay, stated that the integration aims to deliver \"a more unified and convenient experience that reflects how modern investors want to manage their portfolios.\"\n\nCryptocurrency trading on Webull is currently available in the US and Brazil, with the company planning additional market rollouts in coming months. The announcement was made in a press release statement.\n\nWebull operates as an online investment platform serving more than 24 million registered users globally across 14 markets in North America, Asia Pacific, Europe, and Latin America.

Reference actual numbers in your reasoning.\n\n3. **Consistency**: Apply the same scoring standards regardless of the stock. A score of 85 should represent the same quality level across all analyses.\n\n4. **Risk Focus**: Pay special attention to red flags that could invalidate the opportunity (poor liquidity, imminent earnings, deteriorating fundamentals).\n\n5. **Strategy Alignment**: Consider how well this opportunity fits options strategies (directional bias, volatility conditions, time decay considerations).\n\n6. **Completeness Check**: If critical data is missing, note it in your analysis but don't penalize the opportunity excessively for data gaps.\n\nAnalyze the BULL opportunity now using this framework and respond with the required JSON format.",

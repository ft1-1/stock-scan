            "content": "Second quarter earnings season is winding down, and with most of the reports in, the results have been mostly positive.\n\nOver 92% of S&P 500 index companies have reported results, and as of Aug. 18, analysts expected S&P 500 companies to report an 11% jump in earnings per share during the second quarter.\n\nCompanies had lower expectations to clear coming into the quarter — analysts expected S&P 500 earnings to rise 5% in Q2, the slowest pace of earnings growth since Q4 2023 — amid President Trump's tariffs, stocks' lofty valuations, and uncertainty about the health of the US economy.\n\nNvidia (NVDA) results on Wednesday after the bell highlights the week.\n\nOther companies reporting include PDD Holdings (PDD), Alibaba (BABA), Okta (OKTA), Abercrombie & Fitch (ANF), CrowdStrike (CRWD), Five Below (FIVE), HP (HP), Kohl's (KSS), Snowflake (SNOW), J.M.

The Jensen Huang-led company beat estimates on the top and bottom lines and issued Q3 revenue guidance above expectations.\n\nHere's what Nvidia reported against Wall Street analyst estimates, according to Bloomberg data:\n\nFor the third quarter, Nvidia forecast revenue of around $54 billion plus or minus 2%. Expectations were for $53.4 billion.\n\nNvidia stock declined about 0.8% on Thursday. It initially fell 4% after hours following the report's release. Going into the report, options showed traders had priced in a post-earnings swing of roughly 6% — or about $260 billion — in Nvidia shares.\n\nRead more here.\n\n13 mins ago\n\nGrace O'Donnell\n\nGap stock falls on cautious margin outlook\n\nYahoo Finance's Brian Sozzi reports:\n\nRead more here. 53 mins ago\n\nGrace O'Donnell\n\nDell lifts annual forecasts on AI server sales boom\n\nDell (DELL) revenue and adjusted earnings beat estimates, the company reported Thursday.

Today at 2:32 PM UTC\n\nBrooke DiPalma\n\nBest Buy stock dips after the company reiterates guidance, citing uncertainty\n\nBest Buy (BBY) beat all of Wall Street’s key metrics, including revenue, earnings, and same-store sales growth, but maintained its full-year outlook, which slightly disappointed investors. The stock fell 4% in early trading on Thursday.\n\nFor the year, same-store sales are expected to be in a range of down 1% to up 1%. Revenue is forecast to be in the range of $41.1 billion to $41.9 billion, while adjusted earnings per share are guided to be between $6.15 and $6.30.\n\n\"The low end of the range would certainly say we're giving lots of room for a consumer to potentially be more impacted by tariffs,\" CEO Corie Barry said on a call with media, \"but the reason we're pointing to the high end is we don't see evidence that that is going to happen.\"\n\nWall Street expects revenue of $41.36 billion and adjusted earnings of $6.14 for the full fiscal year, per Bloomberg consensus estimates.\n\nBarry said the company plans to lean into promotions this holiday season to ensure it's driving demand for consumers, who have been seeking value for the last year and a half.\n\nRead more here.

It delivered adjusted earnings of $0.94, more than the forecasted $0.69.\n\n\"This unprecedented start to the year is largely a result of a long-term focus on monetizing Build-A-Bear's unique position in the marketplace, multi-generational appeal and exceptional brand recognition to scale the business with innovative initiatives across three strategic pillars,\" CEO and President Sharon Price John told investors on its earnings call.\n\nThe company also raised its 2025 fiscal-year guidance.\n\n\"When considering these results were achieved in a wide variety of economic challenges and geopolitical shifts, they serve as a valuable source of confidence in our team, our brand, our plans and the company's future,\" Price John told investors, \"With that in mind, while we understand a meaningful portion of the year remains and acknowledge the potential for some economic uncertainty ahead, we also believe it is appropriate to increase our 2025 guidance at this juncture.\"\n\nIt now expects revenue to grow on a mid-to-high single-digit basis, up from the previously expected mid-single-digit increase.\n\nIt also plans to open more locations, now in the range of at least 50 to 60.

These offsets, together with our Q1 earnings favorability, provide a path to achieving our original guidance.”\n\nBurlington's Q2 results were better than expected. The retailer reported earnings per share of $1.47 on $2.7 billion in revenue. Wall Street expected earnings of $1.25 per share on revenue of $2.6 billion, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence.

It expects same-store sales to increase 2.1% to 2.6%, compared to its previous expectation of approximately 1.5% to 2.5%.\n\nIn the second quarter, Dollar General stores saw an increase in traffic as its value proposition drew wealthier customers. The company reported earnings of $1.86 per share on $10.7 billion in net sales. Both measures were well ahead of Wall Street estimates.\n\n“Our improved execution, along with our progress advancing key initiatives, is resonating with both existing and new customers as we further enhance our value and convenience proposition,\" CEO Todd Vasos said in a statement.\n\nDollar General stock popped 6% premarket.

            "content": "This article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nCrowdStrike (CRWD, Financials) is still paying for last summer's tech disaster. The cybersecurity company saw its shares slide more than 3% Thursday after issuing a muted revenue outlook for the third quarter a signal that the fallout from its 2024 software update glitch hasn't fully cleared.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 2 Warning Sign with CRWD. Is CRWD fairly valued? Test your thesis with our free DCF calculator.\n\nThe issue dates back to a botched Falcon sensor update that disrupted critical Windows systems, taking down everything from banks and hospitals to airports. While CrowdStrike moved quickly to patch the problem, the event triggered a wave of rebates, discounts, and customer concessions that are now dragging on revenue recognition.\n\nExecutives say these rebate-linked effects are temporary BTIG analysts expect most of the $50 million impact to fade by fiscal 2027. But in the near term, they're complicating the company's ability to show clean top-line growth.\n\nStill, it's not all doom and gloom. Second-quarter revenue rose 21%, underscoring steady cybersecurity demand in a world increasingly focused on AI-powered threat prevention. Morningstar analysts noted that the post-earnings drop seemed more about inflated expectations than anything fundamentally broken.\n\nCrowdStrike has also been expanding its footprint beyond endpoint protection, adding tools for identity verification, cloud security, and full-stack security operations areas that analysts say are gaining traction.\n\nEven so, at least 10 brokerages trimmed their price targets following Wednesday's results, suggesting Wall Street wants to see more clarity before hitting the buy button again.\n\nThe stock has climbed 23.5% year to date, but Thursday's premarket slide could knock roughly $3.5 billion off its valuation if losses hold.\n\nView Comments",

            "title": "CrowdStrike (CRWD) Stock Is Up, What You Need To Know",
            "content": "What Happened?\n\nShares of cybersecurity platform provider CrowdStrike (NASDAQ:CRWD) jumped 3.8% in the afternoon session after investors looked past a soft third-quarter forecast and focused on the company's solid second-quarter earnings results.\n\nThe cybersecurity firm surpassed analyst estimates for the quarter, reporting revenue of $1.17 billion and adjusted earnings of $0.93 per share. Despite this performance, the company's revenue guidance for the next quarter came in slightly below consensus estimates, which initially caused the stock to slide in after-hours trading. However, the morning's rally suggests investors were instead focusing on positive metrics, such as the 20.6% year-over-year growth in Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR) to $4.66 billion and a 4.6% increase in the company's full-year adjusted earnings guidance.\n\nAfter the initial pop the shares cooled down to $440.54, up 4.3% from previous close.\n\nIs now the time to buy CrowdStrike? Access our full analysis report here, it’s free.\n\nWhat Is The Market Telling Us\n\nCrowdStrike’s shares are quite volatile and have had 18 moves greater than 5% over the last year. In that context, today’s move indicates the market considers this news meaningful but not something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business.\n\nThe previous big move we wrote about was 21 days ago when the stock dropped 5.6% on the news that industry bellwether, Fortinet, reported underwhelming second-quarter earnings. The primary concern for investors stemmed from the revelation that the company is already 40-50% of the way through a major firewall refresh cycle, a faster pace than analysts had anticipated. This news suggests that a significant driver of recent growth may be short-lived, and underlying product revenue growth appears weaker than previously thought. The commentary from the industry leader, coupled with multiple analyst downgrades, fueled fears of a broader slowdown in the cybersecurity sector. This led to a ripple effect, dragging down shares of other cybersecurity companies as investors re-evaluate the industry's near-term growth prospects.\n\nCrowdStrike is up 26.8% since the beginning of the year, but at $440.54 per share, it is still trading 14.3% below its 52-week high of $514.10 from July 2025. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of CrowdStrike’s shares 5 years ago would now be looking at an investment worth $3,713.\n\nToday’s young investors likely haven’t read the timeless lessons in Gorilla Game: Picking Winners In High Technology because it was written more than 20 years ago when Microsoft and Apple were first establishing their supremacy. But if we apply the same principles, then enterprise software stocks leveraging their own generative AI capabilities may well be the Gorillas of the future. So, in that spirit, we are excited to present our Special Free Report on a profitable, fast-growing enterprise software stock that is already riding the automation wave and looking to catch the generative AI next.\n\nView Comments",

            "content": "Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) is one of the best long-term stocks to invest in according to Warren Buffett. Two tankers chartered by Chevron carrying Venezuelan crude oil arrived in US waters on August 21. This marks the first US imports of Venezuelan crude in several months. The tankers are scheduled to discharge their cargo at US ports, with one headed to Port Arthur, Texas, and the other to New Orleans, Louisiana.Chevron (CVX) Tankers Deliver Venezuelan Crude to US Ports\n\nGil C / Shutterstock.com\n\nThese oil shipments happened because Chevron received a restricted license from the Treasury Department in late July. This license allows the company to operate in Venezuela and export its crude. It reverses a previous, stricter sanctions policy that had been in effect since April and had caused a three-month pause in Chevron’s Venezuelan oil operations. However, the license carries a strict condition: no money from oil proceeds can be transferred in any way to the administration of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro.\n\nChevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) is an integrated energy company. It explores, produces, and refines oil and natural gas while also manufacturing petrochemicals and transportation fuels. The company operates worldwide across the upstream, midstream, and downstream segments.\n\nWhile we acknowledge the potential of CVX as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.

            "content": "Key Points\n\nBerkshire Hathaway was a net seller of stocks in the first half, but this was because of two big stock sales.  Berkshire added six new stocks to its portfolio in the second quarter of 2025.  Warren Buffett and his team also added to six existing positions. 10 stocks we like better than Berkshire Hathaway ›\n\nWarren Buffett has been a net seller of stocks in 2025. In other words, the volume of stock sales in Berkshire Hathaway's (NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B) closely watched stock portfolio exceeded the amount spent on new purchases.\n\nHowever, that doesn't tell the full story. Specifically, the only reason Berkshire was a net seller of stocks in the first half of 2025 is that the conglomerate executed large sales of both Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) and Bank of America(NYSE: BAC) to trim two of its largest positions.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now. Continue »\n\nOther than these two moves, Berkshire was rather active when it came to buying stocks. This was especially true in the second quarter, which saw a half-dozen new positions added to Berkshire's portfolio, as well as some large additions.\n\nI won't keep you in suspense. In all, Berkshire added six new positions to its stock portfolio during the first half of 2025 and added shares to six existing investments. Here's a rundown of the dozen stocks that Warren Buffett and his team have been loading up on in 2025.\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nStocks Warren Buffett added to Berkshire's portfolio in 2025\n\nThe second quarter was by far the more active period for Buffett and his team, and although Berkshire was a net seller of stocks throughout the first half of 2025 because of the large dispositions I mentioned earlier, several new stocks have been added to the portfolio. Here's a rundown of what they are: Company (Symbol) Shares Bought in Q1 Shares Bought in Q2 Current Value of Berkshire's Investment Nucor(NYSE: NUE) N/A 6,614,112 $857 million Lennar(NYSE: LEN) N/A 7,048,993 $780 million D.R. Horton(NYSE: DHI) N/A 1,485,350 $191 million UnitedHealth Group(NYSE: UNH) N/A 5,039,564 $1.57 billion Lamar Advertising(NASDAQ: LAMR) N/A 1,169,507 $142 million Allegion(NYSE: ALLE) N/A 780,133 $112 million\n\nData source: Berkshire Hathaway SEC filings. Market values as of 6/30/2025.\n\nStocks Warren Buffett has added to in 2025\n\nThere's another category of \"Buffett buys\" to consider -- stocks Berkshire already owned but has added to. And there are a few notable names in this category. Some are relatively new positions that were started within the past year or so that Berkshire seems to be building over time. Others are long-held positions that Berkshire decided to buy more of. Here's the full rundown: Company (Symbol) Shares Added in Q1 Shares Added in Q2 Current Value of Berkshire's Investment Chevron(NYSE: CVX) 763,017 3,454,258 $17.5 billion SiriusXM(NASDAQ: SIRI) 2,308,119 N/A $2.8 billion Constellation Brands(NYSE: STZ) 6,384,676 1,391,000 $2.18 billion Domino's Pizza(NASDAQ: DPZ) 238,613 13,255 $1.19 billion Pool Corp.(NASDAQ: POOL) 865,311 1,994,885 $1.01 billion Heico(NYSE: HEI) 112,401 132,524 $335 million\n\nData source: Berkshire Hathaway SEC filings. Market values as of 6/30/2025. Berkshire reported additions to SiriusXM subsequent to the end of the second quarter.\n\nWhich are the best opportunities for you?\n\nIt's worth pointing out that we don't know why Buffett and his team have been buying shares of these stocks, or even if it was Buffett himself who pulled the trigger. It's likely Buffett was involved in the larger investments, but smaller positions these days are often originated by one of Berkshire's investment managers, Ted Weschler or Todd Combs.\n\nWe also don't know exactly when these purchases were made. For example, were the second quarter purchases made when the market briefly dipped into bear market territory in April, or after the S&P 500 rocketed to new highs in June? A stock that was \"cheap\" at the beginning of the second quarter could be a lot less attractive now.\n\nHaving said that, this activity shows areas of the market where Buffett is finding value this year. And while it's not a great idea to buy any stock just because a billionaire did, even if that billionaire is Warren Buffett, Berkshire's investment activity can be a good source of ideas for your owninvestment researchprocess.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Berkshire Hathaway right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Berkshire Hathaway, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Berkshire Hathaway wasn’t one of them.

            "content": "Occidental Petroleum Corporation OXY stands out in the energy sector with a competitive advantage rooted in its low-cost operations and high-quality asset base. The company has strategically positioned itself to deliver consistent performance across commodity cycles by maintaining operational efficiency and cost discipline. This resilience allows Occidental to sustain profitability even during periods of market volatility.\r\n\r\nThe core strength lies in the company’s high-margin assets across the Permian Basin, where it is one of the largest producers. Its scale, infrastructure ownership and technological expertise enable efficient extraction and development of hydrocarbons, translating into superior returns. The integrated value chain enhances operational flexibility and ensures stronger cash generation compared with peers with less diversified portfolios.\r\n\r\nOccidental also benefits from a strong global portfolio, including assets in the Middle East and Latin America, which provide geographic diversification and stable long-term production. The company views the expertise in carbon dioxide separation, transportation, utilization, recycling and storage through enhanced oil recovery as a key differentiator, giving it a competitive edge over peers as the global economy shifts toward lower-carbon solutions.\r\n\r\nOccidental’s combination of low-cost operations and top-tier assets supports both shareholder value creation and strategic growth. By leveraging these strengths, the company is well-positioned to balance traditional oil and gas production with investments in carbon management and low-carbon technologies, ensuring relevance in an evolving energy landscape.\n\nCompetitive Edge From Efficient Operations and Strong Assets\n\nOil and gas firms that maintain low-cost operations and own high-quality assets achieve greater resilience through market fluctuations, securing consistent cash flow and profitability. Strong asset bases improve production efficiency, while cost discipline enhances margins, supporting long-term growth, stronger competitiveness and lasting value for shareholders.\r\n\r\nCompanies like ExxonMobil XOM and Chevron CVX exemplify how low-cost operations and high-quality assets strengthen performance in the oil and gas sector. ExxonMobil’s integrated portfolio and efficient upstream operations ensure reliable cash flow, while Chevron’s premium Permian assets and disciplined cost structure drive profitability, enabling both companies to withstand price volatility and sustain long-term growth.\n\nOXY’s Price Performance\n\nOccidental’s shares have gained 11.9% in the past three months compared with the Zacks Oil and Gas-Integrated-United States industry’s rise of 7.9%.\n\nStory Continues\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nOccidental’s ROE Is Lower Than the Industry\n\nOccidental’s return on equity (\"ROE\") is lower than the industry average in the trailing 12 months.

            "content": "HOUSTON, August 27, 2025--(BUSINESS WIRE)--This September, Sky High for Kids will turn everyday fill-ups into acts of hope as Danny’s MKT and Star Stop unite across Houston and Austin to benefit children fighting cancer at Texas Children’s Hospital. Beginning September 1 and running through the end of Pediatric Cancer Awareness Month, five cents from every gallon of Chevron gas purchased at Danny’s MKT and designated \"Giving Pump\" stations at select Star Stop locations will support Sky High for Kids’ pledge to Texas Children’s. The campaign has already raised $114,000, with last September’s local generosity fueling $12,000 from Danny’s MKT and $50,000 from Star Stop, proof that small, consistent choices at the pump can add up to lifesaving impact for families close to home.\n\nThe 2025 campaign launches today at Danny’s MKT, 6633 Washington Avenue in Houston, Texas where owner Danny Zalta joined partners to officially cut the ribbon and invite drivers to \"fill it forward\" all month long. \"We’re always happy to do our part,\" said Zalta. \"It means a lot to support kids in our own backyard at Texas Children’s Hospital. Every gallon makes a difference, and we look forward to this campaign every September, honoring Pediatric Cancer Awareness Month.\"\n\nThat spirit of neighborly care is shared by the Panjwani Family, owners of Star Stop, which will feature a dedicated \"Giving Pump\" at 31 Chevron-branded locations across Houston and Austin. \"We’re proud to join the Sky High campaign each year, especially during Pediatric Cancer Awareness Month,\" the family said. \"As a family business, giving back is important to us, and this cause is close to our hearts. We’re always grateful to help raise funds for the kids and families who need it most.\"\n\nThis year’s theme, \"Driving to Your Dream Place,\" centers on original artwork created by two Cancer Warriors treated at Texas Children’s Hospital: Juliana, 8, diagnosed with leukemia in November 2022, and Kennedy, 3, diagnosed with ATRT brain cancer at nine months old in August 2021. Their families met during treatment, and the friendship between Kennedy’s big sister, Reagan, and Juliana inspired the campaign’s joyful visuals, a reminder that the road ahead can hold more than hospitals and hard days. Both Kennedy and Juliana are currently in remission, and their art now rides alongside every gallon that gives back.\n\nIn addition to the funds raised at Danny’s MKT and Star Stop locations, Chevron will be participating in the campaign. At Danny’s MKT, every pump will generate donations throughout September, while Star Stop customers can look for the marked \"Giving Pump\" to ensure their fill-up benefits Sky High for Kids.\n\nStory continues\n\nSky High for Kids exists to end pediatric cancer by funding research, supporting leading pediatric institutions like Texas Children’s Hospital, and easing the burdens families face along the way. When neighbors choose where to fill up this September, they’ll help power more than engines, they’ll help power outcomes for kids who deserve healthy, joy-filled tomorrows.\n\nABOUT SKY HIGH FOR KIDS\n\nSky High for Kids is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization founded by Louisiana native, Brittany Hebert Franklin. Comprised of a devoted staff, board members, and an army of volunteers, they work tirelessly to support children undergoing treatment for cancer and other life-threatening conditions. Their efforts benefit leading hospitals and research centers by closing the gap in childhood cancer rates globally. The Sky High for Kids team is saving kids through advanced medical studies and healing families who are battling cancer now through their comfort programs.\n\nView source version on businesswire.com: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20250827456078/en/\n\nContacts\n\nCrystin Pactor\r\nCrystin@public-content.com \r\n713.443.0929\n\nView comments",

Reference actual numbers in your reasoning.\n\n3. **Consistency**: Apply the same scoring standards regardless of the stock. A score of 85 should represent the same quality level across all analyses.\n\n4. **Risk Focus**: Pay special attention to red flags that could invalidate the opportunity (poor liquidity, imminent earnings, deteriorating fundamentals).\n\n5. **Strategy Alignment**: Consider how well this opportunity fits options strategies (directional bias, volatility conditions, time decay considerations).\n\n6. **Completeness Check**: If critical data is missing, note it in your analysis but don't penalize the opportunity excessively for data gaps.\n\nAnalyze the CVX opportunity now using this framework and respond with the required JSON format.",

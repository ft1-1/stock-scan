            "content": "Have we seen the normal August trading lull that we usually see during the Dog Days of Summer?\n\nOur Chief Equity Strategist and Economist, John Blank, has been keeping his eye on that. He’s here now with the answer.\n\n1. So, until last Friday, have we seen lower daily trading volumes causing higher volatility that would indicate many traders are on summer vacation and, overall, there has been an August lull?\n\n2. Back on August fourth, published data showed the Dow 30 index was the only benchmark that had yet to hit a new peak after April's tariff panic. But that changed last Friday when Fed Chairman Powell signaled the Fed could begin easing monetary policy next month, in his annual Jackson Jole speech. That sent the Dow to an all time high. In fact, there was a pretty broad based stock rally as well. I guess he gave the market exactly what it wanted to hear?\n\n3. September is typically not a good month for stocks. Might this late summer rally extend into next month aided by a rate cut?\n\n4. Is there still uncertainty affecting the market?\n\n5. Is there any reason for stock market bulls to be cautious going into fall?\n\n6. Tech stocks sold off a bit recently. Are investors rotating out of the riskier stocks into previously lagging sectors because they’re worried about the staying power of AI?\n\n7. Will it be difficult to pick winners out of the AI universe going forward?\n\n8. But against this backdrop, does a stronger than expected Q2 earnings season and a bullish outlook for earnings into next year, suggest to you that the S&P500 has more room to run higher, at least, for the rest of this year?\n\n9. Two major U.S. financial services stocks and one major French industrial have been on your radar lately. Charles Schwab SCHW, Citigroup C and Schneider Electric SBGSY.\n\nOur Chief Equity Strategist and Economist, John Blank, on stocks and the August trading lull.

            "content": "For those looking to find strong Finance stocks, it is prudent to search for companies in the group that are outperforming their peers. Is Citigroup (C) one of those stocks right now? Let's take a closer look at the stock's year-to-date performance to find out.\n\nCitigroup is a member of the Finance sector. This group includes 869 individual stocks and currently holds a Zacks Sector Rank of #2. The Zacks Sector Rank considers 16 different sector groups. The average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks within the groups is measured, and the sectors are listed from best to worst.\n\nThe Zacks Rank is a successful stock-picking model that emphasizes earnings estimates and estimate revisions. The system highlights a number of different stocks that could be poised to outperform the broader market over the next one to three months. Citigroup is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy).\n\nOver the past 90 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for C's full-year earnings has moved 3.5% higher. This means that analyst sentiment is stronger and the stock's earnings outlook is improving.\n\nAccording to our latest data, C has moved about 37.6% on a year-to-date basis. In comparison, Finance companies have returned an average of 12.6%. This shows that Citigroup is outperforming its peers so far this year.\n\nAcadian Asset Management (AAMI) is another Finance stock that has outperformed the sector so far this year. Since the beginning of the year, the stock has returned 92.3%.\n\nIn Acadian Asset Management's case, the consensus EPS estimate for the current year increased 30.1% over the past three months. The stock currently has a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).\n\nTo break things down more, Citigroup belongs to the Financial - Investment Bank industry, a group that includes 21 individual companies and currently sits at #11 in the Zacks Industry Rank. On average, stocks in this group have gained 24.6% this year, meaning that C is performing better in terms of year-to-date returns.\n\nIn contrast, Acadian Asset Management falls under the Financial - Miscellaneous Services industry. Currently, this industry has 93 stocks and is ranked #55. Since the beginning of the year, the industry has moved +4.9%.\n\nCitigroup and Acadian Asset Management could continue their solid performance, so investors interested in Finance stocks should continue to pay close attention to these stocks.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

            "title": "Big banks are rallying big time. Can it last?",
            "content": "Hope that the Federal Reserve may soon lower interest rates in September is fueling a new leg to this year’s rally in large US bank stocks.\n\nThey surged last Friday after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell opened the door to a September rate cut, saying in a speech in Jackson Hole that \"the shifting balance of risks may warrant adjusting our policy stance.\"\n\nOn Tuesday, a key index tracking 24 of the country’s largest banks surpassed its previous record high, which hadn't occurred in three years.\n\nThe same index surpassed that level again by Wednesday's close.\n\nThe setup draws parallels to roughly a year ago, when US banks stocks were beating major indexes. The industry’s bigger lenders were coming off a fresh victory in Washington over their capital levels, and the Fed was beginning its rate-cutting cycle.\n\nBack then, banks and their investors were beginning to dream big. Specifically, that 2024 could be the start of another 1995, the beginning of one of the most profitable periods in US banking history.Giving a boost to bank stocks? U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell speaks during a press conference following the issuance of the Federal Open Market Committee's statement on interest rate policy in Washington, D.C., U.S., July 30, 2025. REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst/File Photo·REUTERS / Reuters\n\nDid that come to pass? Will it happen again?\n\n“For banks, I think it's party like it's 1995,” said Mike Mayo, a Wells Fargo bank analyst who admitted that, although \"history isn’t likely to repeat, it may rhyme.”\n\nThat year, 1995, was when the banking industry began one of its best runs ever after a series of rate cuts from the Fed along with passage of a federal law signed by then-President Bill Clinton the year before that allowed for bigger bank mergers.\n\nThrough the end of 1995, the KBW Nasdaq Bank Index (^BKX), which tracks the country's 24 largest banks, finished the year up more than 40%. That outperformance would repeat for two more years.\n\nOver the past 12 months, that same index is up 32%, as of Wednesday.\n\nThe index has outperformed the S&P 500 (^GSPC) and Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) by a respective 16 and 10 percentage points over the past year.\n\n“The bank stocks are once again outperforming the general market,” Gerard Cassidy, a big bank analyst for RBC Capital Markets, told Yahoo Finance. Though Cassidy admitted historical comparisons are rarely perfect, he said he believes “the parallels to the '95 period still hold true.”\n\nThere are plenty of differences between banking today and what was happening in 1995. A crucial one , per Mayo, is that there is simply more “competition for investment dollars” now, given that the technology sector, a dominating force in the US stock market, was still in its infancy back then.\n\nAnother is that the US banking sector has seen substantial consolidation into a handful of megabanks that dominate today’s market.\n\nStory continues\n\nCase in point: All of the 24 original banks listed in the KBW US Bank index when the product first began trading in September 1992 are represented by just eight banks today after a wave of mergers through the late '90s and 2000s.\n\nThe average stock performance between the six biggest lenders in that group — JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Bank of America (BAC), Wells Fargo (WFC), and Citigroup (C), as well as Wall Street banks Goldman Sachs (GS) and Morgan Stanley (MS) — has been 42% over the past year.\n\nThese megabanks have greater scale, more diversification, and bigger capital markets businesses, which have all been bright spots this year, Chris McGratty, a head of KBW’s US bank research, told Yahoo Finance.\n\n“I'll stop short of comparing today to the '90s, but there's a scenario where we're entering a period of strengthening earnings growth across the industry,” McGratty added.A good time to be a big bank? JP Morgan Chase in San Francisco, California, March 18, 2025. (Photo by Smith Collection/Gado/Getty Images)·Smith Collection/Gado via Getty Images\n\nWhile Wall Street banking and other fee services have thrived this year, plain, vanilla bank lending still remains tepid, McGratty added.\n\nFor large regional bank stocks like US Bank (USB), that’s one significant contributor holding up the rebound. Loan growth rose to 4% across US banks in the second quarter, remaining below the pre-pandemic average of 4.9%, according to a FDIC quarterly report.\n\nIf there’s a single reason why bank stocks broadly outside of the country's largest haven’t surged higher over the past year, it's likely due to economic uncertainty from tariffs, according to RBC's Cassidy.\n\nThe notion that the past year would be like 1995 was “temporarily put on hold” when the Federal Reserve began holding interest rates steady due to concerns that tariffs rolled out earlier this year were going to create higher levels of inflation.\n\nIt remains to be seen how the full impact of tariffs will impact inflation. But for now, given Fed Chair Powell's Jackson Hole Speech, the parallel to 1995 is \"back on the table,\" Cassidy said.\n\nClick here for the latest economic news and indicators to help inform your investing decisions\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance\n\nView comments",

During the lightning round, a caller asked for Cramer’s thoughts on the company, and he said:\n\n“Alright, Robinhood’s had an extraordinary move, and usually when you have these extraordinary moves, you gotta let it kind of calm down a little. So I say let it calm down, but don’t forget, it’s an up-stock.”Jim Cramer on Robinhood: \"Let it Calm Down\"\n\nPhoto by Yiorgos Ntrahas on Unsplash\n\nRobinhood Markets, Inc. (NASDAQ:HOOD) operates a financial platform that allows users to trade various asset classes, utilize investing tools, and access features such as fractional trading, retirement accounts, and cryptocurrency wallets. The company also provides educational content, newsfeeds, and a marketplace for digital currencies. It is worth noting that on July 21, Cramer commented:\n\n“PARC exhausts me. I’m talking about my handy acronym for Palantir, AppLovin, Robinhood, and Coinbase. These are four of the many stocks that seem to have no quit in them, even if they all pulled back hard into the close today, giving us a rare moment to evaluate them on relative weakness. It’s better for me to talk about these stocks on a down day so you can get a discount if you were so inclined…\n\nWhile we acknowledge the potential of HOOD as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.

            "content": "The IPO market has been heating up lately as investors pile into riskier areas. Several high-profile private companies, particularly in the AI and crypto space, have debuted this year with strong first-day gains.\n\nIPOs had boomed in 2020 and 2021 when interest rates were ultra-low, and liquidity was abundant. But when the Fed began raising rates, the market collapsed, and IPO activity went into hibernation for nearly two years.\n\nInvest in Gold\n\nPriority Gold: Up to $15k in Free Silver + Zero Account Fees on Qualifying Purchase  Learn More\n\nAmerican Hartford Gold: #1 Precious Metals Dealer in the Nation  Learn More\n\nThor Metals Group: Best Overall Gold IRA  Learn More\n\nPowered by Money.com - Yahoo may earn commission from the links above.\n\nSoftware firm Figma (FIG) more than tripled, and stablecoin issuer Circle (CRCL) more than doubled in their debuts. Since then, Circle is up about 87%, while Figma is down 17%. Bullish (BLSH), which jumped more than 80% on the first day, is now down almost 35%.\n\nHighly anticipated upcoming IPOs include crypto exchange Gemini, payments company Klarna Group, and ticket broker StubHub Holdings.\n\nThe Trump administration is also reportedly considering IPOs for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which could be the largest on record.\n\nIt’s important to remember that not all IPOs are successful. Investing in smaller, lesser-known companies can be quite risky. While a few of these fledgling firms may become excellent long-term investments, others can lead to significant losses.\n\nTrading also tends to be volatile in the first few months as analysts and investors learn more about newly public companies.\n\nAn ETF approach can help reduce risk while still allowing investors to participate in the potential gains of a diversified group of larger, more liquid IPOs.\n\nIPO ETFs provide exposure to newly public companies before they are added to major US equity indexes, which typically include them only after a seasoning period. For example, Google (GOOGL) and Facebook (META) were not added to the S&P 500 until about two years after their IPOs.\n\nThe Renaissance IPO ETF (IPO) holds the largest and most liquid newly listed IPOs. Companies that have been public for three years are removed at the next quarterly review.\n\nThe First Trust US Equity Opportunities ETF (FPX) holds the 100 largest and most liquid IPOs, including spin-offs.

            "content": "If you have been watching Robinhood Markets stock lately, you are not alone. Whether you are considering its notable 161% return so far this year or thinking back on the impressive 406.5% rise over the past twelve months, it would be hard not to stop and wonder what is driving this momentum and whether it is likely to continue. Of course, it has not all been smooth sailing. Robinhood slipped by 2.3% over the past week and dipped 3.6% in the last 30 days. Such swings might feel like simple volatility, but there is usually more going on beneath the surface.\n\nJust this month, BofA nudged its price target upward to $119, suggesting growing confidence from some major analysts. That vote of confidence followed robust sales numbers, which were enough to get the attention of even skeptical investors. Meanwhile, key discussions in fintech are intensifying, with industry leaders, including Robinhood, speaking out about regulatory and competitive risks that could help shape the sector’s future.\n\nYet, with all this activity, Robinhood’s value score remains at a firm 0 out of 6. This is a sign that traditional valuation metrics are signaling caution, at least for now. With numbers this striking, how should Robinhood’s valuation be interpreted today? Let us break down the usual valuation approaches, and stay tuned to explore a fresh perspective that might offer even clearer insight by the article's end.\n\nRobinhood Markets scores just 0/6 on our valuation checks. See what other red flags we found in the full valuation breakdown.\n\nApproach 1: Robinhood Markets Excess Returns Analysis\n\nThe Excess Returns model evaluates how effectively a company generates returns above its cost of equity by reinvesting shareholder capital. This method spotlights whether Robinhood Markets is truly adding economic value beyond what investors could expect elsewhere.\n\nFor Robinhood, the main metrics stand as follows: the Book Value per share is $9.09, and its Stable Earnings Per Share (EPS) is projected at $2.10, based on future Return on Equity estimates from seven analysts. The company’s Cost of Equity per share is $1.01, which means the Excess Return—what is earned above that cost—comes to $1.09 per share. Robinhood’s average Return on Equity is a healthy 17.33%, and its Stable Book Value is anticipated to reach $12.11 per share, according to the consensus of four analyst forecasts.\n\nThe Excess Returns model calculates an intrinsic value of $32.75 per share for Robinhood Markets. Comparing this to the current share price suggests the stock is trading at a 214.3% premium. By this methodology, Robinhood is considered highly overvalued. Investors should note that while Robinhood is delivering returns above its cost of equity, the market’s expectations may be well ahead of the company’s underlying financial fundamentals at this time.\n\nStory continues\n\nResult: OVERVALUED\n\nHead to the Valuation section of our Company Report for more details on how we arrive at this Fair Value for Robinhood Markets.HOOD Discounted Cash Flow as at Aug 2025\n\nOur Excess Returns analysis suggests Robinhood Markets may be overvalued by 214.3%. Find undervalued stocks or create your own screener to find better value opportunities.\n\nApproach 2: Robinhood Markets Price vs Earnings\n\nFor established companies posting steady profits, the Price-to-Earnings (PE) ratio is a go-to valuation metric. It summarizes how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings, making it particularly useful when comparing profitable firms like Robinhood Markets to both their peers and the broader industry.\n\nGrowth expectations and perceived risks play a major role in what is considered a \"fair\" PE ratio. Generally, companies expected to accelerate their earnings growth or seen as more stable and less risky warrant higher multiples, while slower-growth or riskier firms often trade at a discount.\n\nRobinhood’s current PE ratio sits at 51.2x, which is substantially above both the Capital Markets industry average of 27.1x and the average for its peer group at 24.9x. At first glance, this suggests the stock is commanding a premium relative to the market’s typical expectations. However, Simply Wall St’s Fair Ratio for Robinhood is calculated at 28.3x, reflecting a custom benchmark based on the company’s unique growth prospects, risk profile, profit margins, and market cap.\n\nThe Fair Ratio is especially insightful because, unlike a simple industry or peer comparison, it accounts for what actually makes Robinhood distinct: its future earnings potential, sector dynamics, and the quality of those profits. This approach grounds the valuation in forward-looking fundamentals rather than just historical averages.\n\nSince Robinhood’s PE ratio of 51.2x is materially higher than its Fair Ratio of 28.3x, the stock currently appears overvalued by this method.\n\nResult: OVERVALUEDNasdaqGS:HOOD PE Ratio as at Aug 2025\n\nPE ratios tell one story, but what if the real opportunity lies elsewhere? Discover companies where insiders are betting big on explosive growth.\n\nUpgrade Your Decision Making: Choose your Robinhood Markets Narrative\n\nEarlier we highlighted that there is a smarter way to understand valuation. Let us now introduce you to Narratives, a simple, practical framework that empowers you to shape your own perspective on Robinhood Markets by connecting the company’s story to a financial forecast and, ultimately, a fair value.\n\nIn essence, a Narrative is your investment thesis in action. It lets you spell out the reasons behind your expectations for Robinhood’s future revenue, profits, and margins, creating a bridge between qualitative analysis and quantitative outcomes.\n\nNarratives on Simply Wall St’s Community page make it easy for anyone, regardless of experience, to build, share, and follow these story-based valuations. This approach helps millions of investors compare their own view of fair value to the live market price so they can decide when to buy or sell.\n\nUnlike static models, Narratives are living tools that update automatically as new news or earnings data is released, ensuring your investment viewpoint is always current.\n\nFor Robinhood Markets, some believe in a bullish narrative, envisioning rapid growth, robust earnings, and fair value as high as $160 per share. Others see greater risks and slower progress, estimating a fair value closer to $50 per share.\n\nDo you think there's more to the story for Robinhood Markets?

Reference actual numbers in your reasoning.\n\n3. **Consistency**: Apply the same scoring standards regardless of the stock. A score of 85 should represent the same quality level across all analyses.\n\n4. **Risk Focus**: Pay special attention to red flags that could invalidate the opportunity (poor liquidity, imminent earnings, deteriorating fundamentals).\n\n5. **Strategy Alignment**: Consider how well this opportunity fits options strategies (directional bias, volatility conditions, time decay considerations).\n\n6. **Completeness Check**: If critical data is missing, note it in your analysis but don't penalize the opportunity excessively for data gaps.\n\nAnalyze the HOOD opportunity now using this framework and respond with the required JSON format.",

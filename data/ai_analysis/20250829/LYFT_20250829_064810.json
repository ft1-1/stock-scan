            "content": "DoorDash DASH is benefiting from the robust growth in its Marketplace GOV, driven by strong demand across platforms. In the second quarter of 2025, Marketplace GOV increased 23% year over year to $24.2 billion. The figure beat the Zacks Consensus mark by 2.67%.\r\n\r\nIn the second quarter of 2025, revenues increased 24.9% year over year to $3.28 billion. The net revenue margin rose to 13.5% in the second quarter of 2025 from 13.3% in the year-ago quarter. Growth was driven by the year-over-year increase in Marketplace GOV.\r\n\r\nDoorDash’s expanding partner base has been noteworthy. It includes Dollar General, McDonald’s, Walmart’s Canadian division, Walmart Canada, Wegmans Food Markets, Lyft, Warner Bros. Discovery’s streaming service, Max, and JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s U.S. consumer and commercial banking division, Chase, which have acted as catalysts for growth, significantly broadening DoorDash’s reach and enhancing its service offerings.\r\n\r\nThe company is consistently investing in expanding its partner base to provide express grocery delivery for consumers, a new offering that cements its position further among other on-demand delivery platforms. It partnered with retailers like CUB, Eataly, El Super, Fiesta Mart, Lowe’s Markets, Pruett’s Food, Stater Bros. Markets, and Strack & Van Til to broaden its reach and offerings for consumers in various regions on the DoorDash Marketplace. These partnerships boost DoorDash’s total orders and marketplace GOV.\n\nFor the third quarter of 2025, DoorDash anticipates Marketplace GOV to be in the range of $24.2-$24.7 billion.\n\nDASH Faces Stiff Competition\n\nDoorDash is constantly battling for market share with other local food delivery logistics platforms such as Uber Technologies UBER, online delivery platform Uber Eats, and Maplebear CART, which is doing business as Instacart. As competition intensifies, companies are seeking new ways to differentiate themselves and expand their market presence.\r\n\r\nUber Technologies is benefiting from the boom in its Delivery business. Uber Technologies’ delivery business performed well in the second quarter of 2025, with segmental revenues growing 23% year over year on a constant-currency basis. Gross bookings from the Delivery segment in the June quarter rose 20% year over year on a constant-currency basis to $21.7 billion.\r\n\r\nIn the second quarter of 2025, Maplebear, doing business as Instacart, reported a Gross Transaction Value of $9.081 billion, reflecting 11% growth compared with $8.194 billion in the second quarter of 2024.  Maplebear’s growth was fueled by a 17% increase in orders, reaching 82.7 million.  This highlights Maplebear’s strong presence and competitive edge in the online delivery market.\n\nStory Continues\n\nDASH’s Share Price Performance, Valuation, and Estimates\n\nDoorDash’s shares have rallied 48.3% in the year-to-date period, significantly outperforming the Zacks Internet - Services industry’s rise of 10.8% and the broader Zacks Computer & Technology sector’s growth of 13%.\n\nDASH PerformanceZacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nDoorDash shares are currently overvalued, as suggested by its Value Score of F.  In terms of the forward 12-month Price/Sales ratio, DASH is trading at 11.90, higher than its median of 9.73 and the industry’s 5.41.\n\nDASH ValuationZacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nFor 2025, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at $2.39 per share, indicating a 10.6% increase over the past 30 days.

            "content": "Investing.com - RBC Capital has reiterated an Outperform rating on Lyft (NASDAQ:LYFT) with a price target of $21.00 following investor meetings with the company’s CEO and VP of FP&A/IR.\n\nThe investment firm remains constructive on the stock, highlighting several \"shots on goal\" that could drive durable growth in Lyft’s core ride-hailing business. This optimism is supported by the company’s robust revenue growth of nearly 20% in the last twelve months and analysts’ expectations of continued profitability this year.\n\nRBC Capital notes that Lyft’s ability to address autonomous vehicles has \"greatly expanded\" through its Freenow acquisition, which also supports the company’s international expansion plans.\n\nThe firm points to Lyft’s margin leverage and strong cash flow as factors enabling increased capital returns to shareholders, suggesting the current buyback program may be \"too low\" given the company’s valuation.\n\nAccording to RBC Capital, Lyft currently trades at 8.5 times EV to estimated 2026 EBITDA and 5.7 times the company’s 2027 EBITDA target, which the firm views as an \"attractive valuation.\"\n\nIn other recent news, Lyft has announced significant changes in its leadership structure as co-founders Logan Green and John Zimmer will step down from the company’s board of directors on August 14, 2025. This move completes a two-year leadership transition that began with the hiring of CEO David Risher. Alongside their departure, the co-founders will convert their Class B shares to Class A shares, eliminating the dual-class share structure and ensuring equal voting rights for all shareholders. This conversion will leave them with approximately 9.69 million shares of Lyft Class A common stock.\n\nIn terms of financial outlook, Lyft expects third-quarter gross bookings to range between $4.65 billion and $4.80 billion, marking a 15% year-over-year growth at the midpoint, which is 3% higher than analyst estimates. Analysts have weighed in on these developments, with TD Cowen reiterating a Buy rating and a $22.00 price target, while RBC Capital continues to rate Lyft as Outperform with a $21.00 price target. On the other hand, Susquehanna has lowered its price target to $14.00, maintaining a Neutral rating, partly due to concerns about European expansion. Despite investor skepticism, Lyft’s management remains confident about the company’s growth prospects.\n\nThis article was generated with the support of AI and reviewed by an editor.

            "title": "UBER vs. LYFT: Which Ride-Hailing Stock Has an Edge Now?",
            "content": "Uber Technologies UBER and Lyft (LYFT) are prominent players in the ride-hailing industry. Both companies have significantly transformed the transportation space with their innovative ride-sharing business models.\n\nUber, headquartered in San Francisco, has taken a broad diversification approach, expanding its presence worldwide. While ride-hailing remains its core business, Uber has branched out into food delivery and freight services, aiming for rapid growth across multiple areas. Lyft, also based in San Francisco, follows a more streamlined strategy by focusing mainly on ride-hailing within the United States.\n\nGiven this backdrop, let’s examine closely to find out which ride-hailing entity currently holds the edge, and more importantly, which might be the smarter investment now.\n\nThe Case for Uber\n\nUber holds a dominant position in the North American ride-hailing market. Beyond the United States, it has expanded operations into Canada, Latin America, Europe, the Middle East, and Asia (excluding China).\n\nFor large companies, diversification is key to mitigating risks, and Uber has excelled on this front. The company has pursued numerous acquisitions, product expansions, and geographic diversification while driving innovation. Its efforts to grow in international markets are noteworthy, providing the benefits of geographical balance. Strategic investments have enabled Uber to broaden its service portfolio and strengthen its overall business. It has diversified into food delivery through Uber Eats. Recently, Uber Eats and retailer Dollar General DG inked a partnership to deliver household essentials across the United States. As a result of the deal, more than 14,000 Dollar General and pOpshelf locations are being brought to the Uber Eats platform. Customers can use the Uber Eats app to order food, beverages and other essentials like personal care products, over-the-counter medications, among other items.\n\nUnder the partnership, which kicked off on Aug. 8, Uber Eats is offering 40% off on Dollar General and pOpshelf orders of $20 or more. The maximum discount amounts to $10. Uber also has a presence in freight services.\n\nBoth Uber’s ride-sharing and delivery platforms continue to gain popularity, fueling strong demand. Coupled with new growth initiatives and disciplined cost management, this momentum is supporting the company’s performance. In the second quarter of 2025, revenues from the delivery segment grew 23% year over year on a constant-currency basis. Gross bookings from the segment in the June quarter rose 20% year over year on a constant-currency basis to $21.7 billion.\n\nStory Continues\n\nAnother positive factor is Uber’s buyback program. Recently, management announced a stock repurchase authorization of up to an additional $20 billion of common stock. With this bold initiative, UBER is not only enhancing shareholder value but also signaling confidence in its current business strategy. The latest shareholder-friendly announcement by Uber is in addition to the $7 billion authorization announced in 2024. We remind investors that the $7 billion share repurchase authorization was the first such program in the company's history. The accelerated $1.5 billion stock buyback program, a part of the $7 billion program, was completed in the first quarter of 2025. In 2024, Uber generated a record $6.9 billion in free cash flow, highlighting its financial bliss, with an adjusted EBITDA of $6.5 billion.\n\nLooking forward, Uber is aiming to establish itself as a leader in the rapidly expanding robotaxi market by forming strategic partnerships. This collaborative approach allows the company to avoid the substantial R&D expenses that usually come with developing autonomous systems on its own.\n\nThe Case for LYFT\n\nLyft is benefiting from the increase in gross bookings. Gross bookings are improving mainly due to the growing active rider base, expansion into new markets and the success of the company’s customer-friendly \"Price Lock\" feature.\n\nRecently, Lyft released its second-quarter 2025 earnings report. In the June quarter, gross bookings increased 12% year over year to $4.5 billion. This was the 17th consecutive quarter where Lyft demonstrated double-digit year-over-year growth in the key metric, demonstrating the resilience and momentum of the company’s customer-friendly strategy. For the third quarter of 2025, it expects gross bookings in the $4.65-$4.8 billion range, indicating 13-17% growth from the third-quarter 2024 actuals.\n\nLYFT’s move to focus on less densely populated markets, such as Indianapolis, is paying off. Its Price Lock feature is also doing well. With the return-to-office mode gaining steam, there is a surge in weekday demand for ride-hailing services. To compete more effectively with rivals in the ride-hailing arena, Lyft has introduced a Price Lock feature. This feature allows users to bypass surge pricing during peak commuting hours. By locking in a commute price, they can save money. LYFT, like Uber, aims to gain a stronghold in the highly promising robotaxi market through strategic partnerships.\n\nAnother area of confidence is LYFT’s buyback strategy. In a shareholder-friendly move, management announced earlier in the year an increase to its share repurchase program to $750 million from $500 million. In the second quarter of 2025, LYFT repurchased $200 million worth of stock. Strong cash flow generation allows it to remain committed to returning value to shareholders. LYFT’s cash flow generation stood at $993 million for the trailing 12 months at the end of the second quarter of 2025.\n\nHow Do Zacks Estimates Compare for Uber & Lyft?\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for Uber’s 2025 and 2026 sales implies a year-over-year increase of 16.8% and 15.6%, respectively.

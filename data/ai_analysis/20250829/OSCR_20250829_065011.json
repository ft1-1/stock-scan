            "content": "Oscar Health recently announced a partnership with Hy-Vee, Inc to offer innovative healthcare benefits, despite reporting a net loss of $228 million in their second-quarter earnings. The company's stock experienced a 23% price increase in the last quarter, aligning largely with the 18% yearly rise of the broader market, suggesting broader market trends rather than specific company catalysts may have played a significant role. However, the strategic partnership and reaffirmed corporate guidance likely added positive undertones to the stock's performance, especially amid the healthcare sector's evolving landscape.\n\nYou should learn about the 1 possible red flag we've spotted with Oscar Health.OSCR Earnings Per Share Growth as at Aug 2025\n\nDiversify your portfolio with solid dividend payers offering reliable income streams to weather potential market turbulence.\n\nThe partnership between Oscar Health and Hy-Vee, Inc. could play a key role in shaping the company's direction, potentially enhancing future revenue streams and earnings forecasts. With Oscar Health focusing on digital efficiencies amid higher claims costs and evolving policy risks, the collaboration may offer new avenues for exploiting technological advancements, possibly bolstering their strategy to mitigate rising expenses and regulatory challenges. The strategic alliance could support digital innovation, aiding profitability goals despite the existing vulnerabilities highlighted in the narrative.\n\nOver a three-year period, Oscar Health’s total shareholder return was 178.56%. Although impressive, the stock underperformed the US market over the past year, which grew by 17.5%. Additionally, it lagged behind the US Insurance industry, which saw returns of 2.3% within the same period. These performance metrics underline the nuanced position Oscar Health holds amid industry peers and broader market movements.\n\nDespite recent positive news, the stock's current price of US$17.02 remains above analysts' consensus price target of US$11.14, suggesting the market might have higher expectations than analysts do. This implies the potential for reevaluation if projected improvements in revenue and profit margins, such as anticipated annual revenue growth to US$12.6 billion and earnings reaching US$239 million by 2028, do not materialize as expected. Investors may need to consider whether the forecasted financial improvements justify the current pricing. As Oscar Health navigates industry shifts and expanding partnerships, ongoing performance will be crucial for aligning market expectations with analyst predictions.\n\nStory Continues\n\nReview our growth performance report to gain insights into Oscar Health's future.\n\nThis article by Simply Wall St is general in nature.

            "content": "Investing.com - Cantor Fitzgerald maintained its Neutral rating and $38.00 price target on Centene (NYSE:CNC) stock on Tuesday. The healthcare provider’s shares, which have declined nearly 49% over the past six months, currently trade at an attractive 7.1x P/E ratio. According to InvestingPro analysis, the stock appears undervalued at current levels.\n\nThe investment firm’s decision comes after analysis of Kaiser Family Foundation data showing Centene proposed the highest rate increases in 29% of states where it operates.\n\nAccording to the data, Centene is seeking the highest rates in 8 of its 28 states captured in the Kaiser data, comparable to UnitedHealth’s 31% and Molina’s 27%, while Cigna and Oscar Health were not the highest in any states.\n\nCantor Fitzgerald noted that despite these aggressive rate increase proposals, it believes Centene is unlikely to exit any state markets.\n\nThe firm indicated its outlook on Centene has worsened based on the data showing the company is pursuing the highest possible rates in multiple states.\n\nIn other recent news, Centene Corporation reported its Q2 2025 results, revealing a significant earnings miss with an adjusted loss per share of $0.16, falling short of the forecasted earnings per share of $0.23. Despite this earnings miss, the company experienced strong revenue performance, which contributed to a positive outlook for future profitability. In another development, Centene announced the resignation of Director Wayne S. DeVeydt, reducing the board size to ten members. The company clarified that DeVeydt’s resignation was not due to any disagreement with Centene or its board. Meanwhile, Cantor Fitzgerald downgraded Centene’s stock rating from Overweight to Neutral, citing macroeconomic uncertainties in the Health Insurance Exchange and Medicaid markets. The firm also lowered its price target significantly, expressing concerns about Centene’s earnings exposure to the HIX segment. In other corporate news, eHealth, Inc. appointed Derrick Duke as its new CEO, effective September 18, 2025, succeeding Fran Soistman, who will retire but remain on the Board of Directors and serve as an executive advisor through the end of the year.\n\nThis article was generated with the support of AI and reviewed by an editor.

            "title": "December 2027 Options Now Available For Oscar Health (OSCR)",
            "content": "Investors in Oscar Health Inc (Symbol: OSCR) saw new options become available today, for the December 2027 expiration.  One of the key data points that goes into the price an option buyer is willing to pay, is the time value, so with 844 days until expiration the newly available contracts represent a potential opportunity for sellers of puts or calls to achieve a higher premium than would be available for the contracts with a closer expiration.   At Stock Options Channel, our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the OSCR options chain for the new December 2027 contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.\n\nThe put contract at the $17.00 strike price has a current bid of $6.90.  If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $17.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $10.10 (before broker commissions).  To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of OSCR, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $17.25/share today.\n\nBecause the $17.00 strike represents an approximate 1% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless.  The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 79%.  Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the contract detail page for this contract.  Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 40.59% return on the cash commitment, or 17.55% annualized — at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost.\n\nBelow is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Oscar Health Inc, and highlighting in green where the $17.00 strike is located relative to that history:\n\nTurning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $22.00 strike price has a current bid of $7.20.  If an investor was to purchase shares of OSCR stock at the current price level of $17.25/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a \"covered call,\" they are committing to sell the stock at $22.00.  Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 69.28% if the stock gets called away at the December 2027 expiration (before broker commissions).  Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if OSCR shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Oscar Health Inc, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important.   Below is a chart showing OSCR's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $22.00 strike highlighted in red:\n\nConsidering the fact that the $22.00 strike represents an approximate 28% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected.  The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 30%.  On our website under the contract detail page for this contract, Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted).   Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 41.74% boost of extra return to the investor, or 18.05% annualized, which we refer to as the YieldBoost.\n\nThe implied volatility in the put contract example is 96%, while the implied volatility in the call contract example is 84%.\n\nMeanwhile, we calculate the actual trailing twelve month volatility (considering the last 249 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $17.25) to be 82%.

            "title": "Jefferies, Oscar Health, Compass Diversified, Payoneer, and TowneBank Stocks Trade Up, What You Need To Know",
            "content": "What Happened?\n\nA number of stocks jumped in the afternoon session after the major indices rebounded, as Fed Chair Jerome Powell delivered dovish remarks at the much-awaited Jackson Hole symposium. Powell suggested that with inflation risks moderating and unemployment remaining low, the Federal Reserve might consider a shift in its monetary policy stance, including potential interest rate cuts. This outlook eased market concerns about prolonged high interest rates and their impact on economic growth. The prospect of lower borrowing costs bolstered investor confidence, particularly in sectors that have lagged, leading to a broad rally across the market.\n\nThe stock market overreacts to news, and big price drops can present good opportunities to buy high-quality stocks.\n\nAmong others, the following stocks were impacted:\n\nInvestment Banking & Brokerage company Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) jumped 5.4%.

Access our full analysis report here, it’s free.\n\nZooming In On Oscar Health (OSCR)\n\nOscar Health’s shares are extremely volatile and have had 64 moves greater than 5% over the last year. In that context, today’s move indicates the market considers this news meaningful but not something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business.\n\nThe previous big move we wrote about was 2 days ago when the stock dropped 8.4% on the news that the major indices continued to pull back, with technology stocks accounting for most of the market's largest decliners.\n\nA key reason for this trend is that much of the recent market gains were concentrated in the \"AI trade,\" which includes these large technology and semiconductor companies. So this could also mean that some investors are locking in some gains ahead of more definitive feedback from the Fed. Despite the downturn, some analysts viewed this as an opportunity to own some of the \"Core AI winners.\" Dan Ives of Wedbush Securities commented, \"In our view, the tech bull cycle will be well intact for at least another 2-3 years, given the trillions being spent on AI infrastructure/software/chips/power/apps looking ahead. This remains our tech playbook and investor roadmap.\"\n\nStory Continues\n\nAdditionally, mixed earnings reports from retailers, such as Target, have added to the market's weakness. Investors are closely monitoring these reports for insights into the broader economic health and the potential impact of new tariffs on inflation.\n\nOscar Health is up 22.4% since the beginning of the year, but at $16.59 per share, it is still trading 28.7% below its 52-week high of $23.27 from September 2024. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of Oscar Health’s shares at the IPO in March 2021 would now be looking at an investment worth $476.72.\n\nUnless you’ve been living under a rock, it should be obvious by now that generative AI is going to have a huge impact on how large corporations do business. While Nvidia and AMD are trading close to all-time highs, we prefer a lesser-known (but still profitable) semiconductor stock benefiting from the rise of AI.

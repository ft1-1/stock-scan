            "content": "We came across a bullish thesis on Rubrik, Inc. on Wolf of Harcourt Street’s Substack. In this article, we will summarize the bulls’ thesis on RBRK. Rubrik, Inc.'s share was trading at $88.77 as of August 22nd. RBRK’s trailing P/E were 25.58 according to Yahoo Finance.SentinelOne (S) Expands Mimecast Partnership to Advance Human-Centric Cybersecurity\n\nDen Rise/Shutterstock.com\n\nRubrik, founded in 2014 and public since April 2024, is a SaaS-based cyber resilience company built around its Rubrik Security Cloud platform, enabling secure backup, recovery, and protection against ransomware and operational disruptions. Recognized as a Gartner Magic Quadrant leader for six years, it has evolved beyond traditional backup to provide a zero-trust, machine learning–driven model that safeguards enterprise data across hybrid and multicloud environments. Its offerings span backup, ransomware recovery, immutable data storage, automation, and compliance, positioning it as both a digital vault and an “undo button” for cyberattacks.\n\nRubrik’s moat is still developing but shows traction: switching costs rise with platform integration, network effects strengthen through partner ecosystems and threat intelligence, and enterprises realize significant TCO savings, especially in complex environments. Scale remains a work in progress as incumbents and hyperscalers maintain strong positions, but Rubrik’s growth trajectory signals long-term potential. Financially, Rubrik reported Q1 FY26 revenue of $278 million, up 49% YoY, with 95% subscription-based sales. Large enterprise adoption is accelerating, with 2,391 customers contributing over $100K in ARR, up 29% YoY, while NRR above 120% reflects world-class retention and expansion.\n\nDespite a -33% operating margin, gross margins are robust at 78%, and the company has turned free cash flow positive at $33 million, aided by efficiency gains. With a $16 billion market cap and shares at $83.97, valuation reflects high growth expectations, but its positioning in a $50 billion TAM, coupled with founder-led leadership, Microsoft’s backing, and rising enterprise demand for resilience, creates a compelling long-term investment case.\n\nPreviously we covered a bullish thesis on Rubrik, Inc. (RBRK) by ElectSamsepi0l in December 2024, which highlighted rapid ARR growth, strong partnerships, and leadership moves that strengthened its market position. The company’s stock has appreciated about 65% since our coverage as execution boosted confidence. The thesis still stands. Wolf of Harcourt Street shares a similar view but emphasizes financial traction and moat development.\n\nRubrik, Inc. is not on our list of the 30 Most Popular Stocks Among Hedge Funds. As per our database, 45 hedge fund portfolios held RBRK at the end of the first quarter which was 41 in the previous quarter. While we acknowledge the potential of RBRK as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk. If you're looking for an extremely undervalued AI stock that also stands to benefit significantly from Trump-era tariffs and the onshoring trend, see our free report on the best short-term AI stock.\n\nStory Continues\n\nREAD NEXT: 8 Best Wide Moat Stocks to Buy Now and 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock.\n\nDisclosure: None.\n\nView Comments",

On August 12, the company announced the launch of Agent Rewind, an industry-first agent rewind solution that enables organizations to undo mistakes made by agentic AI. Powered by Predibase AI infrastructure, Agent Rewind provides visibility into agents’ actions and enables enterprises to rewind those changes to applications and data.\n\nWhile AI agents boast significant potential, they are still prone to mistakes ranging from technical malfunctions and legal issues and even erasing of entire production databases. This is where the Agent Rewind comes into use by making opaque AI actions visible, auditable, and reversible.Rubrik (RBRK) Launches Agent Rewind to Undo AI Agent Mistakes\n\nThe solution creates an audit trail and immutable snapshots that allow safe rollback. Rubirk highlighted that current observability tools only show what happened, but not why or how to reverse high-risk actions.\n\nAgent Rewind is compatible with a wide range of platforms, APIs, and agent builders, including Agentforce, Microsoft Copilot Studio, and Amazon Bedrock Agents, and will be compatible with any custom AI agent.\n\n“As AI agents gain autonomy and optimize for outcomes, unintended errors can lead to business downtime. Agent Rewind integrates Predibase’s advanced AI infrastructure with Rubrik’s recovery capabilities to enable enterprises to embrace agentic AI confidently. Today’s organizations will now have a clear process to trace, audit, and safely rewind undesired AI actions.” -Anneka Gupta, Chief Product Officer at Rubrik.\n\nRubrik, Inc.

Reference actual numbers in your reasoning.\n\n3. **Consistency**: Apply the same scoring standards regardless of the stock. A score of 85 should represent the same quality level across all analyses.\n\n4. **Risk Focus**: Pay special attention to red flags that could invalidate the opportunity (poor liquidity, imminent earnings, deteriorating fundamentals).\n\n5. **Strategy Alignment**: Consider how well this opportunity fits options strategies (directional bias, volatility conditions, time decay considerations).\n\n6. **Completeness Check**: If critical data is missing, note it in your analysis but don't penalize the opportunity excessively for data gaps.\n\nAnalyze the RBRK opportunity now using this framework and respond with the required JSON format.",

            "content": "Key Points\n\nCNBC's Jim Cramer recently suggested that Rigetti Computing stock could have big upside.  Cramer had previously indicated Rigetti looked like a poor play in the quantum space, so the change in commentary is notable.  Rigetti recently released its most powerful quantum computing platform, and it potentially has some big catalysts on deck later in the year. 10 stocks we like better than Rigetti Computing ›\n\nRigetti Computing(NASDAQ: RGTI) stock is soaring higher in Thursday's daily trading session. The quantum computing specialist's share price was up 9.6% as of 3:15 p.m. ET. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 had risen 0.3%, and the Nasdaq Composite was up 0.6%. The quantum stock had been up as much as 12.2% earlier today.\n\nRigetti's valuation is surging thanks to recent comments from Jim Cramer, the host of CNBC's Mad Money television show. With today's pop, the stock is now up roughly 19% over the last three months despite some big volatility across the stretch.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now. Continue »\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nRigetti stock soars as Cramer shifts his stance\n\nIn yesterday's episode of Mad Money, host Jim Cramer had some encouraging things to say about Rigetti:\n\nRigetti could have something that could be a home run. RGTI is one that could have a headline tomorrow. I don't want to keep you out of it.\n\nThe host's comments look particularly notable given that he had indicated earlier this year that Rigetti could be the worst play among the basket of high-flying quantum computing stocks.\n\nWhat's next for Rigetti?\n\nWith the second-quarter report it published earlier this month, Rigetti announced that its Cepheus-1-36Q had become commercially available. The company says that its 36-qubit multichip quantum computer is offering industry-leading performance, and it will pave the way for the launch of the Rigetti Quantum Cloud Services Platform on Microsoft's Azure cloud infrastructure service in the near future.\n\nRigetti also said that it's on track to launch its 100+ qubit system by the end of the year. While the stock remains a high-risk, speculative play, the quantum computing player appears to be making meaningful progress with its tech platform.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Rigetti Computing right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Rigetti Computing, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Rigetti Computing wasn’t one of them.

            "title": "QBTS or RGTI: Which Stock Will Win As IBM, MSFT, NVIDIA Back Quantum?",
            "content": "D-Wave Quantum QBTS and Rigetti Computing RGTI are stepping into the spotlight as speculative pure plays in the emerging quantum economy, buoyed by the growing interest of big technology players in the quantum landscape.\n\nInternational Business Machines IBM recently partnered with Advanced Micro Devices or AMD to build quantum-centric supercomputers, a major step toward merging quantum and classical computing at scale. Microsoft MSFT is also advancing its “Quantum Safe” roadmap, aiming to embed post-quantum cryptography across its platforms by 2029-2033. Meanwhile, NVIDIA NVDA is expanding its hybrid-computing push by launching a large Quantum-AI research center to advance quantum-classical integration. This surge of attention by the bigwigs is drawing fresh investor focus toward the smaller players.\n\nAgainst this big-tech momentum, QBTS and RGTI stand as potential market movers, though their future remains uncertain in a market defined by both exponential opportunity and existential risk.\n\nLet's delve deeper.Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nMeanwhile, over the past six months, shares of QBTS have skyrocketed 210.8%, strongly outperforming RGTI’s 99.9% gain. Both the stocks marched well ahead of the S&P 500 index’s 11.6% rise.\n\nHow D-Wave is Placed in the Evolving Landscape\n\nD-Wave is a leading commercial provider of annealing quantum systems, different from rivals pursuing gate-model architectures. The May 2025 launch of its Advantage2 quantum computer was a major milestone, showcasing real-world quantum supremacy in materials simulation and delivering significant performance gains in coherence, energy scaling and qubit connectivity. D-Wave argues that annealing is not a niche technology but a scalable solution for optimization, simulation and AI workloads — a view supported by growing partnerships with firms like Japan Tobacco, Triumph and global institutions such as Yonsei University and the Julich Supercomputing Center.\n\nOn the financialside, the last-reported second-quarter 2025 revenues rose 42% year over year to $3.1 million, with bookings nearly doubling and margins above 70%. Crucially, a record $819 million cash balance gives the company resources to advance its roadmap toward 100,000 qubits and expand hybrid quantum-AI applications. With customers spanning GE Vernova, Nikon, NTT, Sharp and Oxford University, D-Wave is proving annealing’s versatility.\n\nRigetti's Current Stance on Path to Quantum Edge\n\nRigetti is gaining market share based on its chiplet-based architecture as the foundation for scaling superconducting qubits. Cepheus-1-36Q, launched earlier this month, has been recognized as the industry’s largest multi-chip quantum computer. It is claimed to reduce error rates at a rapid pace, achieving a two times improvement in 2-qubit gate fidelity over its prior Ankaa-3 system in just six months. By leveraging chiplet technology from the semiconductor industry, Rigetti is moving beyond monolithic designs and gaining better manufacturing yields and consistency while proving that multi-chip scaling is both feasible and advantageous. The company is confident that this approach will enable the release of a 100+ qubit system with 99.5% median 2-qubit gate fidelity by year-end 2025, a milestone that would significantly advance the roadmap toward error correction and fault tolerance.\n\nStory Continues\n\nOn the financial side, Rigetti strengthened its position with $350 million in at-the-market equity financing, ending the last-reported second quarter with $571.6 million in cash and no debt, providing the resources to support commercial scale-up. However, revenues were down year over year due to delays in U.S. government funding programs like the National Quantum Initiative. While gross margins fell to 31% and losses widened, management highlighted that technical milestones, not current revenues, are the core metric of long-term success.\n\nBig Tech Momentum: Boon or Bane for QBTS and RGTI?\n\nThe growth of Big Tech in quantum computing is both good and bad for smaller companies like D-Wave and Rigetti. On the one hand, companies such as IBM, Microsoft and NVIDIA are investing billions into quantum hardware, software and security, raising the visibility of the whole sector and attracting fresh capital. This helps smaller companies because customers, investors and governments are more willing to take quantum seriously when big names are involved. For both D-Wave and Rigetti, this momentum provides credibility and a stronger market context.\n\nOn the other hand, Big Tech’s size and resources make the competitive environment tough. D-Wave and Rigetti both face the risk of being overshadowed by larger players who can afford longer R&D timelines and broader market reach.\n\nAverage Target Price for D-Wave Suggests a Better Upside\n\nBased on short-term price targets offered by 10 analysts, QBTS’ average price target represents an increase of 37.22% from the last closing price of $15.45.Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nBased on short-term price targets offered by six analysts, RGTI’s average price target represents an increase of 16.54% from the last closing price of $15.3.Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nD-Wave Pulls Ahead as Big Tech Fuels Quantum Momentum\n\nWhile D-Wave and Rigetti currently have a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) each, the evidence points to QBTS being better positioned in the near term. Its strong revenue growth, robust cash reserves, expanding commercial partnerships and higher analyst upside potential give it an edge over Rigetti, which is still contending with government funding delays and widening losses despite impressive technical milestones. This advantage is especially important as big tech giants like IBM, Microsoft and NVIDIA accelerate quantum adoption and validation, further raising the stakes for all players in the space.

Reference actual numbers in your reasoning.\n\n3. **Consistency**: Apply the same scoring standards regardless of the stock. A score of 85 should represent the same quality level across all analyses.\n\n4. **Risk Focus**: Pay special attention to red flags that could invalidate the opportunity (poor liquidity, imminent earnings, deteriorating fundamentals).\n\n5. **Strategy Alignment**: Consider how well this opportunity fits options strategies (directional bias, volatility conditions, time decay considerations).\n\n6. **Completeness Check**: If critical data is missing, note it in your analysis but don't penalize the opportunity excessively for data gaps.\n\nAnalyze the RGTI opportunity now using this framework and respond with the required JSON format.",

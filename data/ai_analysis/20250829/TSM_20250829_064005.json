On August 26, Nikkei Asia reported that Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. Ltd. (NYSE:TSM) is phasing out Chinese chipmaking equipment from its most advanced plants. The decision reflects preparation for potential U.S. restrictions that could affect production and market access. The company is removing Chinese tools from its new 2-nanometer lines, which are scheduled to begin mass output this year.\n\nThis move follows a push by U.S. lawmakers to limit technology that could benefit China’s strategic industries. The proposed Chip EQUIP Act would also bar companies receiving U.S. subsidies from using equipment sourced from foreign entities of concern, including Chinese suppliers.Strong Market Position Shields TSMC (TSM) from Geopolitical Headwinds\n\nPixabay/Public Domain\n\nThe restrictions primarily target chips with 7nm or smaller dimensions, which are critical for AI data centers. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Ltd.’s (NYSE:TSM) decision to act now is seen as a way to preserve subsidy eligibility while also lowering regulatory and operational risks.\n\nEven with these geopolitical headwinds, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Ltd. (NYSE: TSM) remains central to the global semiconductor supply chain, given its dominant position in advanced manufacturing. The consensus price target suggests a potential upside of around 15% from current levels.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Ltd.

Also, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) issued unsecured bonds to the tune of NT$12.3 billion, possessing varied maturity periods and interest rates.Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (TSM) Highlights Key Changes and Activities\n\nIn Q2 2025, the company reported consolidated revenue of NT$933.79 billion, net income of NT$398.27 billion, and diluted EPS of NT$15.36 (US$2.47 per ADR unit). On a YoY basis, its revenues rose 38.6%, while net income and diluted EPS both went up by 60.7%. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM)’s business in Q2 2025 was supported by continued strong AI and HPC-related demand. In Q3 2025, it expects its business to be aided by healthy demand for its leading-edge process technologies.\n\nBaron Funds, an investment management company, released its investor letter for Q2 2025. Here is what the fund said:\n\n“Our largest add during the quarter was Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) as we continued to build our position. We believe that while near-term uncertainty due to tariffs and macro remains heightened, TSMC’s competitive positioning in leading-edge semiconductor manufacturing remains unmatched. We also believe that TSMC will benefit from a long duration of growth as the adoption of AI proliferates across industries – and the recent developments in the space which we discussed above (e.g. removal of the AI Diffusion rule, accelerated adoption of reasoning-based AI inference, and the expansion of scaling laws) will serve to further accelerate the adoption of AI. We also like the fact that TSMC will benefit regardless of the ultimate market share split between GPUs and application-specific integrated circuits. It’s the ultimate “arms dealer” to AI.”\n\nWhile we acknowledge the potential of TSM as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.

Moor Insights & Strategy founder, CEO, and chief analyst, Patrick Moorhead, explains that it might take more than the government's investment for Intel to find a dominant position in the global chip supply chain.\n\nTo watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Market Domination Overtime.\n\nVideo Transcript\n\n00:00 Speaker A\n\nIntel CFO uh said that they've received uh $5.7 billion under the Trump investment deal. That is a little bit of a a different deal, but do you do you hold the same sort of line of thought as for that as well?\n\n00:13 Speaker B\n\nSo, they're not doing a 15% on the top. It's a 9.9% uh equity equity deal and that's actually less unprecedented. The US government took equity positions in GM and Chrysler, uh in AIG and even Palenteer through the CIA's venture arm. I think short-term uh to give a boost and you if I look at that converted stock, it does create cash on the balance sheet that they can put uh put against uh foundry, so that is a positive thing. I think long-term, it just doesn't feel right to anybody right now, even though uh the Taiwanese government owned 6% of of TSMC and in fact, they were a 40 48% uh founder of of of TSMC. It just still doesn't seem right that when you get government investment and ends up, well, the good thing about this and I think the way investors should look at this is there's no voting rights here. So, it's not like you're going to have the government pushing them around, vetoing things that might be good for the company and the government just doesn't agree on with the whims of the administration. and I think that that should give people a little bit of a uh a better feeling. You know, even the Nippon uh steel acquisition of US steel, they had hooks in there that clearly said, you can if you are going to make certain decisions, you need to seek our approval first. But I think the one thing that I haven't seen yet, that I think is the most important thing is is that if the US government does doesn't put their finger on the scale, uh to put a little uh teeth into design houses, not using Intel founder, I think it's going to be all for not. Intel has the possibility to build 14A based on all this capital and customers uh don't show up.

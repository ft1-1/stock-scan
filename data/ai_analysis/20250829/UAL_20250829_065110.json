            "title": "Can United Airlines Holdings, Inc.'s (NASDAQ:UAL) ROE Continue To Surpass The Industry Average?",
            "content": "While some investors are already well versed in financial metrics (hat tip), this article is for those who would like to learn about Return On Equity (ROE) and why it is important. To keep the lesson grounded in practicality, we'll use ROE to better understand United Airlines Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:UAL).\n\nReturn on equity or ROE is a key measure used to assess how efficiently a company's management is utilizing the company's capital. Simply put, it is used to assess the profitability of a company in relation to its equity capital.\n\nWe've found 21 US stocks that are forecast to pay a dividend yield of over 6% next year. See the full list for free.\n\nHow To Calculate Return On Equity?\n\nReturn on equity can be calculated by using the formula:\n\nReturn on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity\n\nSo, based on the above formula, the ROE for United Airlines Holdings is:\n\n25% = US$3.3b ÷ US$13b (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2025).\n\nThe 'return' refers to a company's earnings over the last year. Another way to think of that is that for every $1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn $0.25 in profit.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for United Airlines Holdings\n\nDoes United Airlines Holdings Have A Good Return On Equity?\n\nOne simple way to determine if a company has a good return on equity is to compare it to the average for its industry. However, this method is only useful as a rough check, because companies do differ quite a bit within the same industry classification. Pleasingly, United Airlines Holdings has a superior ROE than the average (13%) in the Airlines industry.NasdaqGS:UAL Return on Equity August 27th 2025\n\nThat's what we like to see. With that said, a high ROE doesn't always indicate high profitability. A higher proportion of debt in a company's capital structure may also result in a high ROE, where the high debt levels could be a huge risk .  Our risks dashboardshould have the 2 risks we have identified for United Airlines Holdings.\n\nWhy You Should Consider Debt When Looking At ROE\n\nCompanies usually need to invest money to grow their profits. That cash can come from issuing shares, retained earnings, or debt. In the first two cases, the ROE will capture this use of capital to grow. In the latter case, the use of debt will improve the returns, but will not change the equity. That will make the ROE look better than if no debt was used.\n\nUnited Airlines Holdings' Debt And Its 25% ROE\n\nUnited Airlines Holdings clearly uses a high amount of debt to boost returns, as it has a debt to equity ratio of 2.02. Its ROE is pretty impressive but, it would have probably been lower without the use of debt. Debt does bring extra risk, so it's only really worthwhile when a company generates some decent returns from it.\n\nStory continues\n\nConclusion\n\nReturn on equity is one way we can compare its business quality of different companies. A company that can achieve a high return on equity without debt could be considered a high quality business. If two companies have around the same level of debt to equity, and one has a higher ROE, I'd generally prefer the one with higher ROE.\n\nBut when a business is high quality, the market often bids it up to a price that reflects this. The rate at which profits are likely to grow, relative to the expectations of profit growth reflected in the current price, must be considered, too. So you might want to take a peek at this data-rich interactive graph of forecasts for the company.\n\nOf course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking elsewhere.

            "content": "[A mother and her daughter running down a palm tree scattered beach in Costa Rica.]\nJordan Siemens/DigitalVision via Getty Images\n\nAlthough still down from 2024, travel trends are improving, according to data compiled by Wedbush, suggesting a more favorable range of outcomes this year versus initial expectations.\n\nBut the progress is not being experienced equally across the industry, Wedbush’s Scott Devitt found, with international demand remaining healthy while hotel booking trends, including alternative lodging, showing a deceleration in July.\n\nFor names like Airbnb (NASDAQ:ABNB [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ABNB]), the data suggests the implied results are trending below management guidance and consensus estimates that call for stable nights booked growth. For the third quarter, Wedbush estimates room night growth of 7.1% year-over-year, versus +7.4% growth for Q2.\n\nFor Booking.com (NASDAQ:BKNG [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BKNG]) demand growth has remained healthy in Europe, but continues to slow, with nights booked rising 5% year-over-year in July but decelerating 500 basis points from +10% year-over-year in Q2. Travel trends outside the U.S. have been softer versus the second quarter, and performance is tracking in line with expectations. This indicates Q3 room night growth of +5.5% year over year from +7.7% in the second quarter,\n\nFinally, travel trends have been encouraging for Expedia (NASDAQ:EXPE [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/EXPE]) relative to initial expectations. In July alternative lodging nights booked growth has decelerated ~300 basis points from Q2 to +1% year-over-year (pertaining to the company’s Vrbo business), while U.S. hotel data was consistent with prior months, suggesting only slightly negative RevPAR growth in July.\n\nAir travel has improved slightly in early Q3, averaging ~1% growth from roughly flat growth in Q2. Wedbush’s data shows inbound air travel from Europe to the U.S. was down 3% in July year-over-year while outbound air travel for the U.S. to Europe improved by 6% from +4% year-over-year in the second quarter.\n\nMORE ON BOOKING HOLDINGS, AIRBNB, ETC.\n\n \t* Airbnb's Unique Demand Driver [https://seekingalpha.com/article/4816878-airbnbs-unique-demand-driver]\n \t* Expedia Has 40%+ Upside Potential Over The Next 12 Months [https://seekingalpha.com/article/4815616-expedia-has-40-percent-plus-upside-potential-over-the-next-12-months]\n \t* Expedia: Bookings Acceleration Offset By Market Share Fears (Upgrade) [https://seekingalpha.com/article/4815136-expedia-bookings-acceleration-offset-by-market-share-fears-upgrade]\n \t* Airbnb snaps six straight sessions of gains [https://seekingalpha.com/news/4487591-airbnb-snaps-six-straight-sessions-of-gains]\n \t* Airbnb launches more flexible payment options with Reserve Now, Pay Later [https://seekingalpha.com/news/4485607-airbnb-launches-more-flexible-payment-options-with-reserve-now-pay-later]\n\n ",

            "title": "Another Insider Sells United Airlines Stock",
            "content": "On Aug. 14, 2025, United Airlines Holdings (NASDAQ:UAL)Executive Vice President of Human Resources and Labor Relations Kate Gebo reported the sale of 36,296 shares of the company in multiple open-market transactions on Aug. 12, 2025, totaling approximately $3.5 million.\n\nTransaction summary MetricValueShares traded36,296Transaction value$3,543,618.30Post-transaction shares114,602Post-transaction value$11,284,858.941-year performance139.9%\n\nTransaction value is based on the SEC Form 4 reported price of $97.63. post-transaction value based on Aug. 12, 2025 market close price of $98.47.”\n\nKey questions\n\nHow significant was the transaction relative to Gebo's recent trading history?\r\nThe sale of 36,296 shares is slightly above Gebo's median sell size of 35,000 shares since April 18, 2024. The Aug. 12 transactions represented 24.05% of her holdings at the time, exceeding her recent median of 18.83% per sale.\n\nWhat do post-transaction holdings indicate about remaining ownership?\r\nAfter the sale, Gebo retains 114,602 shares, valued at approximately $11.3 million as of Aug. 12, 2025, based on the closing share price that day. This represents about 0.04% of United Airlines Holdings' outstanding shares as of the Aug. 14, 2025, SEC filing.\n\nHow does the sale align with the company's recent share price performance?\r\nThe transaction occurred at a share price of $97.63, following a period when United Airlines Holdings delivered a 137.5% total return in the 12 months prior.\n\nDoes the pattern of recent sales reflect available capacity or a shift in trading approach?\r\nThe increased proportion of holdings sold in this transaction is explained by Gebo's reduced base of available shares, following prior sales that have cumulatively reduced her holdings by 46.9% since April 2024. As such, the larger percentages per transaction are a function of diminished remaining capacity rather than a discretionary change in trading strategy.\n\nCompany overview MetricValueMarket capitalization$32.67 billionRevenue (TTM)$57.99 billionNet income (TTM)$3.31 billion1-year price change137.5%\n\n* 1-year price change calculated using Aug. 12, 2025, as the reference date.\n\nCompany snapshot\n\nProvides passenger and cargo air transportation services, as well as ancillary offerings such as catering, ground handling, training, and maintenance for third parties.Generates revenue primarily through ticket sales, cargo transport, and service contracts, leveraging a global route network and diversified fleet.Serves individual travelers and freight customers throughout North America, Asia, Europe, Africa, the Pacific, the Middle East, and Latin America.\n\nUnited Airlines Holdings operates as a leading global airline, with a broad international footprint and a comprehensive service portfolio. Its competitive edge lies in its diversified offerings and ability to serve a wide range of markets through both mainline and regional fleets.\n\nFoolish take\n\nUnited Airlines Executive Vice President of Human Resources and Labor Relations Kate Gebo recently sold shares worth about $3.5 million, leaving her and her spouse holding a total of 114,602 shares worth about $11.8 million at the time of this writing. This sale came a few days after board member Barney Harford also sold a significant amount of stock.\n\nIt also came a couple of weeks after United Airlines' flight attendants overwhelmingly rejected a new labor deal. A new round of contract negotiations has been scheduled to get underway in December.\n\nIf you believe in reading in the tea leaves of insider trades, then these developments could easily be put together to form a negative narrative, not least as growth expectations have already been pared back across the airline industry this year due to the uncertainty created by President Donald Trump's tariffs.\n\nThat said, United is one of the better-placed airlines, and the industry appears to be acting in a disciplined manner by cutting back on capacity as demand for tickets wanes. United's loyalty programs and co-branded credit cards continue to engender customer engagement and generate income. As such, this airline is better able to cushion itself from the blows of rising airport fees and taxes than low-cost carriers are, making it one of the best stocks to buy in the sector.\n\nGlossary\n\nInsider transaction: The buying or selling of a company's securities by its executives, directors, or significant shareholders.\r\nOpen-market transaction: A trade executed on a public exchange, rather than through private arrangements or company programs.\r\nForm 4: A required SEC filing that discloses insider trades of company stock by officers, directors, or major shareholders.\r\nMedian sell size: The middle value of share amounts sold in a series of insider transactions, used to measure typical sale size.\r\nOutstanding shares: The total number of a company's shares currently held by all shareholders, including insiders and the public.\r\nTotal return: The investment's price change plus all dividends and distributions, assuming those payouts are reinvested.\r\nMaterial equity exposure: A significant ownership stake in a company, often used to indicate meaningful alignment with shareholder interests.\r\nAncillary offerings: Additional services provided by a company beyond its core business, such as catering or maintenance.\r\nRegional fleet: Aircraft operated on shorter routes, often by partner airlines, to serve smaller markets.\r\nTTM: The 12-month period ending with the most recent quarterly report.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now\n\nWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

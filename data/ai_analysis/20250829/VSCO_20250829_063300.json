Sekella explained, \"We've really made a conscious effort to pull back on promos and the traditional discounts. We expect that to continue into the back half.\"\n \t* Michael Vu, Barclays, asked about international category performance. Super said, \"Intimates business is very strong there... it's really the 2 core categories of Beauty as well as intimates both doing very well globally.\"\n \t* Mauricio Serna Vega, UBS, requested details on tariffs.

            "content": "Key Points\n\nVictoria's Secret delivered a second quarter above expectations. Management attributes the change to some new leadership and better execution. The stock is still cheap, but the company must continue to fend off new competition and activist investors. 10 stocks we like better than Victoria's Secret & Co. ›\n\nShares of Victoria's Secret(NYSE: VSCO) rallied on Thursday, up as much as 11.8% before retreating to a 4.8% gain as of 10:26 a.m. ET.\n\nVictoria's Secret reported second-quarter earnings today, which beat analyst expectations on both the top and bottom lines. The company has recently revamped some of its leadership, and it appears those moves are paying off.\n\nVictoria's Secret's top line gets a lift\n\nIn the second quarter, Victoria's Secret grew revenue 2.8% to f $1.46 billion, on the back of a solid 4% lift in comparable-store sales. Victoria's Secret continues to rationalize its store footprint, and it seems to be yielding positive traffic at its remaining stores. Meanwhile, adjusted non-GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles) earnings per share of $0.33 handily beat estimates by $0.20, above the previously guided range.\n\nManagement also raised full-year revenue guidance to a range of $6.33 billion to $6.41 billion, compared to prior guidance of $6.20 billion to $6.30 billion, with an adjusted operating income range of $270 million to $320 million, despite an increased $100 million impact from tariffs.\n\nCEO Hillary Super noted it was \"our first full quarter under our refreshed leadership team, and the impact was clear -- sharper execution, reenergized culture, and more high-emotion storytelling, delivering significant momentum as we enter the back half of the year.\"Image source: Getty Images.\n\nWill results shrug off activists?\n\nVictoria's Secret had come under fire from activist investors a couple of months ago, who demanded the company's chairman and rest of the board step down after years of underperformance. So perhaps the strong results will keep these investors happy for the time being.\n\nIn any case, the stock looks cheap at 12 times this year's earnings estimates. While this year's earnings should mark a decline from 2024, it also includes a negative tariff impact, which should theoretically only be a one-time cost.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Victoria's Secret & Co. right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Victoria's Secret & Co., consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Victoria's Secret & Co. wasn’t one of them.

Reference actual numbers in your reasoning.\n\n3. **Consistency**: Apply the same scoring standards regardless of the stock. A score of 85 should represent the same quality level across all analyses.\n\n4. **Risk Focus**: Pay special attention to red flags that could invalidate the opportunity (poor liquidity, imminent earnings, deteriorating fundamentals).\n\n5. **Strategy Alignment**: Consider how well this opportunity fits options strategies (directional bias, volatility conditions, time decay considerations).\n\n6. **Completeness Check**: If critical data is missing, note it in your analysis but don't penalize the opportunity excessively for data gaps.\n\nAnalyze the VSCO opportunity now using this framework and respond with the required JSON format.",

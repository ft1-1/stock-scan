            "content": "What Happened?\n\nA number of stocks fell in the afternoon session after markets pulled back with the decline concentrated in the tech space as investors engaged in profit-taking following a robust week that saw the S&P 500 hit a new record.\n\nAdding to the pressure, new inflation data, specifically the Core PCE, showed an acceleration in July, signaling that rising prices remain a risk despite being in line with expectations. This confluence of factors, including market highs heading into a historically weak September, led to a pullback, with the Nasdaq Composite shedding 1.15%. While the Federal Reserve has hinted at potential rate cuts, the focus on inflation and the jobs market continues to influence investor sentiment.\n\nThe stock market overreacts to news, and big price drops can present good opportunities to buy high-quality stocks.\n\nAmong others, the following stocks were impacted:\n\nElectronic Components & Manufacturing company Amphenol (NYSE:APH) fell 3%. Is now the time to buy Amphenol? Access our full analysis report here, it’s free. Discount Grocery Store company Dollar General (NYSE:DG) fell 3.1%. Is now the time to buy Dollar General?

Discount Retailer company Ollie's (NASDAQ:OLLI) fell 3.6%. Is now the time to buy Ollie's? Access our full analysis report here, it’s free. Aerospace company AerSale (NASDAQ:ASLE) fell 3.7%. Is now the time to buy AerSale? Access our full analysis report here, it’s free.\n\nZooming In On AerSale (ASLE)\n\nAerSale’s shares are quite volatile and have had 17 moves greater than 5% over the last year. In that context, today’s move indicates the market considers this news meaningful but not something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business.\n\nThe previous big move we wrote about was 21 days ago when the stock gained 9.1% on the news that the company posted second-quarter results that beat analyst expectations on both the top and bottom lines.\n\nThe aviation solutions provider reported adjusted earnings of $0.20 per share, crushing Wall Street's consensus estimate of $0.03. Revenue also impressed, rising 39.3% year-over-year to $107.4 million, which was well ahead of the $86.33 million analysts had anticipated. This performance highlights healthy demand for the company's offerings, which include sales, leasing, and maintenance for mid-life commercial aircraft. The company's profitability saw a dramatic improvement, as its operating margin surged to 11.7%, a significant turnaround from a negative 2.4% in the same quarter last year. This strong bottom-line result was also reflected in its free cash flow, which turned positive at $18.61 million, compared to a burn of $18.94 million in the prior-year period.\n\nStory Continues\n\nAerSale is up 39.9% since the beginning of the year, and at $8.62 per share, it is trading close to its 52-week high of $9 from August 2025. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of AerSale’s shares 5 years ago would now be looking at an investment worth $838.52.\n\nToday’s young investors likely haven’t read the timeless lessons in Gorilla Game: Picking Winners In High Technology because it was written more than 20 years ago when Microsoft and Apple were first establishing their supremacy. But if we apply the same principles, then enterprise software stocks leveraging their own generative AI capabilities may well be the Gorillas of the future. So, in that spirit, we are excited to present our Special Free Report on a profitable, fast-growing enterprise software stock that is already riding the automation wave and looking to catch the generative AI next.\n\nView Comments",

            "content": "Marvell Technology, Inc. MRVL came out with second-quarter fiscal 2026 earnings of 67 cents per share, in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. This compares to earnings of 30 cents per share a year ago. The bottom line increased 123.3% year over year and 8.1% sequentially, driven by higher revenues and effective cost management.\n\nMarvell Technology’s earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters, with an average surprise of 3.6%.\n\nMRVL’s second-quarter fiscal 2026 revenues of $2.01 billion for the quarter ended July 2025, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0.23%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $1.27 billion.\n\nSecond-quarter revenues grew 57.6% year over year and 5.8% sequentially, mainly driven by strong growth in the data center and continued recovery in enterprise networking and carrier infrastructure end markets.\n\nMarvell Technology, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise\n\nMarvell Technology, Inc. price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Marvell Technology, Inc. Quote\n\nMarvell Technology’s Q2 End Market Details\n\nMarvell Technology’s top-line growth was supported by impressive performances across its segments, which rose sequentially, while the data center segment registered phenomenal growth both year over year and quarterly.\n\nData center revenues of $1.49 billion increased 69.2% year over year and 3.5% sequentially. The top line showed robust improvement due to traction in custom XPU silicon, electro-optics interconnect products, and next-generation switch divisions primarily drove the robust increase. The segment accounted for 74.3% of the quarter’s total revenues, demonstrating that it is currently MRVL’s largest end market. Our estimate for the Data Center’s fiscal second-quarter revenues was pegged at $1.5 billion.\n\nRevenues from enterprise networking rose 28.2% year over year and 9.1% sequentially to $193.6 million, and accounted for 9.7% of the total revenues. The year-over-year rise was primarily driven by the normalization of inventory levels. Our estimate for enterprise networking’s fiscal second-quarter revenues was pegged at $185.1 million.\n\nCarrier infrastructure revenues, which accounted for 6% of the total revenues, rose 71% year over year but declined 6% sequentially to $130 million, reflecting demand recovery. Our estimate for the carrier infrastructure’s fiscal second-quarter revenues was pegged at $144.5 million.\n\nAutomotive/Industrial revenues were flat year over year and sequentially at $76 million, mainly due to continued weakness across the industrial market, offsetting automotive recovery. Revenues from this segment constituted 4% of the total revenues. Our estimate for Automotive/Industrial’s fiscal second-quarter revenues was pegged at $75.6 million.\n\nStory Continues\n\nConsumer revenues, representing 6% of the total revenues, increased 30% year over year and 84% sequentially to $116 million. Our estimate for Consumer’s fiscal second-quarter revenues was pegged at $94.7 million.\n\nMRVL's Q2 Operating Details\n\nMarvell Technology's non-GAAP gross profit of $1.19 billion reflected an increase of 62.9% year over year and 6.0% sequentially. However, the non-GAAP gross margin of 59.4% contracted 250 basis points (bps) year over year and 40 bps sequentially.\n\nNon-GAAP operating expenses totaled $492.6 million compared with $455.8 million in the year-ago quarter and $486.2 million in the previous quarter. The non-GAAP operating margin of 34.8% expanded 870 bps year over year and 60 bps sequentially.\n\nMarvell Technology Initiates Guidance for Q3\n\nConsidering the continued robust demand for its custom AI chips, Marvell Technology initiated strong revenue guidance for the third quarter. It expects revenues to be $2.06 billion (+/- 5%). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $2.01 billion, implying 57.96% year-over-year improvement.\n\nThe non-GAAP gross margin is projected to be in the 59.5-60.0% range, while non-GAAP operating expenses are estimated to be around $485 million.\n\nThe company projects non-GAAP earnings per share for the fiscal third quarter to be 74 cents (+/- 5 cents), while the consensus mark for the same is currently pegged at 67 cents. The figure indicates a strong year-over-year improvement of 123.33%.\n\nMRVL’s Zacks Rank and Stocks to Consider\n\nMRVL currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).\n\nAlkami Technology ALKT, Arista Networks ANET and Amphenol APH are some better-ranked stocks that investors can consider in the broader Zacks Computer & Technology sector. While ANET and ALKT carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) each, APH sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) at present. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\n\nAlkami Technology shares have lost 34.5% year to date. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Alkami Technology’s full-year 2025 earnings is pegged at 15 cents per share, up by 2 cents over the past 30 days, implying growth of 51.7% from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure.\n\nArista Networks shares have lost 11.9% year to date.

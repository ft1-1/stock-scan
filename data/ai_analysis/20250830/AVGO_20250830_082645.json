            "content": "The S&P 500 Index ($SPX) (SPY) on Friday closed down by -0.64%, the Dow Jones Industrials Index ($DOWI) (DIA) closed down by -0.20%, and the Nasdaq 100 Index ($IUXX) (QQQ) closed down by -1.22%.  September E-mini S&P futures (ESU25) fell -0.68%, and September E-mini Nasdaq futures (NQU25) fell -1.31%.\n\nStock indexes retreated on Friday, weighed down by weakness in technology stocks.  Marvell Technology tumbled more than -18% to lead semiconductor stocks lower after reporting that Q2 data center revenue missed estimates.  Also, Dell Technologies fell more than -8% to lead computer hardware stocks lower after reporting tighter profit margins on AI servers. Join 200K+ Subscribers: Find out why the midday Barchart Brief newsletter is a must-read for thousands daily.\n\nStocks added to their losses after the August MNI Chicago PMI fell more than expected and after the University of Michigan's US August consumer sentiment index was unexpectedly revised lower.  Also, inflation pressures remain sticky after the US July core PCE price index, the Fed's preferred inflation gauge, rose by the most in five months.\n\nOn the positive side for stocks, US consumer demand remains resilient after July personal spending rose by the most in four months.  Also, the University of Michigan's inflation expectations were unexpectedly revised lower. In addition, dovish comments from Fed Governor Waller and San Francisco Fed President Daly were bullish for stocks as they signaled their support for Fed rate cuts.\n\nUS July personal spending rose +0.5% m/m, the most in four months, and right on expectations.  July personal income rose +0.4% m/m, right on expectations.\n\nThe US July core PCE price index, the Fed's preferred inflation gauge, rose to a 5-month high of +2.9% y/y from +2.8% y/y in June, right on expectations but well above the Fed's 2% inflation target.\n\nThe US Aug MNI Chicago PMI fell -5.6 to 41.5, weaker than expectations of 46.0.\n\nThe University of Michigan's Aug US consumer sentiment index was revised lower by -0.4 to 58.2, weaker than expectations of no change at 58.6.\n\nThe University of Michigan Aug 1-year inflation expectations were unexpectedly revised slightly lower by -0.1 to 4.8%, weaker than expectations of an upward revision to 5.0%. The Aug 5-10 year inflation expectations were revised lower by -0.4 to 3.5% from the previously reported 3.9%.\n\nLate Thursday, Fed Governor Christopher Waller stated that he supports a 25-bp rate cut at the September FOMC meeting and anticipates additional rate cuts over the next three to six months.  He said, \"With underlying inflation close to 2%, market-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations firmly anchored, and the chances of an undesirable weakening in the labor market increased, proper risk management means the FOMC should be cutting the policy rate now.\"\n\nSan Francisco Fed President Mary Daly signaled she's open to lower interest rates soon, saying, \"It will soon be time to recalibrate policy to better match our economy.\" She added that tariff-related price increases \"will be a one-off\" and it \"will take time before we know that for certain, but we can't wait for perfect certainty without risking harm to the labor market.\"\n\nRegarding tariffs, President Trump on Monday threatened to impose new tariffs and export restrictions on advanced technology and semiconductors in retaliation against other nations' digital services taxes that hit American companies.  Last week, Mr. Trump widened steel and aluminum tariffs to include more than 400 consumer items that contain the metals, such as motorcycles, auto parts, furniture components, and tableware.  The change went into effect last Monday and did not exclude goods already in transit.\n\nIn other recent tariff news, Mr. Trump on August 13 extended the tariff truce with China for another 90 days until November.  On August 6, Mr. Trump announced that he will double tariffs on US imports from India to 50% from the current 25% tariff, due to India's purchases of Russian oil.  According to Bloomberg Economics, the average US tariff will rise to 15.2% if rates are implemented as announced, up from 13.3% earlier, and significantly higher than the 2.3% in 2024 before the tariffs were announced.\n\nFederal funds futures prices are discounting the chances for a -25 bp rate cut at 88% at the next FOMC meeting on September 16-17.  The markets are discounting the chances at 55% for a second -25 bp rate cut at the following meeting on October 28-29.\n\nEarnings reports indicate that S&P 500 earnings for Q2 are on track to rise +9.1% y/y, much better than the pre-season expectations of +2.8% y/y and the most in four years, according to Bloomberg Intelligence.  With Q2 earnings season winding down, over 95% of S&P 500 firms having reported Q2 earnings, about 82% of companies exceeded profit estimates.\n\nOverseas stock markets on Friday settled mixed.  The Euro Stoxx 50 fell to a 2-week low and closed down -0.83%.  China's Shanghai Composite closed up +0.37%.  Japan's Nikkei Stock 225 closed down -0.26.\n\nInterest Rates\n\nSeptember 10-year T-notes (ZNU5) Friday closed down -2.5 ticks, and the 10-year T-note yield rose +2.4 bp to 4.227%.\n\nSep T-notes posted modest losses on Friday after the US July core PCE price index, the Fed's preferred inflation gauge, rose to a 5-month high of +2.9% y/y.  T-notes also have carryover pressure from weakness in 10-year German bunds after the German Aug CPI rose more than expected.\n\nLosses in T-notes were limited after Fed Governor Christopher Waller said he supports a 25 bp rate cut at the September FOMC meeting and anticipates additional rate cuts over the next three to six months.  Also, the University of Michigan's Aug inflation expectations were revised lower, a dovish factor for Fed policy.\n\nEuropean government bond yields on Friday moved higher.  The 10-year German bund yield rose +2.9 bp to 2.724%.  10-year UK gilt yield rose +2.2 bp to 4.722%.\n\nThe ECB's July 1-year CPI expectations remained unchanged from June at +2.6%, which is stronger than the expected +2.5%.  The ECB Jul 3-year CPI expectations unexpectedly climbed to +2.5%, stronger than expectations of no change at +2.4%.\n\nGerman Aug unemployment unexpectedly fell by -9,000, showing a stronger labor market than expectations of +10,000.\n\nGerman Jul retail sales fell -1.5% m/m, weaker than expectations of no change and the biggest decline in almost two years.\n\nGerman Aug CPI (EU harmonized) rose +2.1% y/y, stronger than expectations of +2.0% y/y.\n\nSwaps are discounting the chances at 2% for a -25 bp rate cut by the ECB at the September 11 policy meeting.\n\nUS Stock Movers\n\nChipmakers sold off on Friday, led by an -18% plunge in Marvell Technology (MRVL) to lead losers in the Nasdaq 100 after it reported Q2 data center revenue of $1.49 billion, below the consensus of $1.52 billion.  Also, Lam Research (LRCX) closed down more than -4%, and Broadcom (AVGO), Nvidia (NVDA), and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) closed down more than -3%.  In addition, ARM Holdings Plc (ARM), ASML Holding NV (ASML), Applied Materials (AMAT), KLA Corp (KLAC), Intel (INTC), ON

consumers.\n\nCaterpillar (CAT) closed down more than -3% to lead losers in the Dow Jones Industrials after warning that it faces a larger-than-anticipated tariff headwind of as much as $1.8 billion this year.\n\nDollar General (DG) closed down more than -2% despite reporting better-than-expected Q2 EPS after it said it expects \"more pressure\" in selling, general, and administrative (SG&A) expenses in Q3 and warned of tougher gross margin comparison in Q4.\n\nCryptocurrency-exposed stocks fell Friday after the price of Bitcoin (^BTCUSD) dropped more than -3% to a 7-week low.  As a result, Galaxy Digital (GLXY) closed down more than -4%, and Coinbase Global (COIN) and Strategy (MSTR) closed down more than -1%.\n\nAutodesk (ADSK) closed up more than +9% to lead gainers in the S&P

            "title": "Wall Street’s Momentum Train Hits Full Speed Into September",
            "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Even after Friday’s stock dip, Wall Street’s risk-on momentum train is barreling into September at full steam — and few investors are showing signs of hesitation.\n\nMarkets barely flinched this week — despite fresh political pressure on the Federal Reserve and tepid Nvidia Corp. revenue guidance — until a tech-led pullback Friday, amid thin trading. Yet the late-week wobble only offered a flicker of doubt in an otherwise resilient summer, with the S&P 500 notching a fourth straight monthly gain.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nAmtrak Debuts New High-Speed Acela Trains After Years of Delays To Boost Housing, Chicago Kills Parking Minimums Central Glasgow Could Be Poised for a Revival NY Penn Station’s Long-Awaited Revamp to Start Work in 2027 Chicago Schools’ Late Pension Payment Magnifies Fiscal Mess\n\nRisk appetite continues to spill into nearly every corner of markets, from corporate bonds and cryptocurrencies to cyclical currencies. The rationale feels deceptively simple: the Fed looks poised to cut interest rates, the US consumer has so far proved the doubters wrong, and the artificial intelligence story still commands momentum.\n\nThat logic has proven resilient even in the face of mounting risks. Trade frictions, a cooling labor market and conflicting bond signals haven’t derailed the rally. If anything, they’ve hardened bets that monetary support is imminent — and that the expansion, while aging, still has legs.\n\nOne way to dissect the bullishness is a cross-asset momentum gauge maintained by Societe Generale SA. It blends 11 components, including copper versus gold, cyclical stocks versus defensive, crypto, high-yield bonds and more. It has flirted with the most bullish thresholds at least five times since the tariff-spurred fallout in April — including again this month.\n\n“Investors are realizing that the impact of tariffs is not as catastrophic as initially feared and that’s giving them more confidence — a confidence now underscored by solid fundamentals,” said Omar Aguilar, CEO of Charles Schwab Investment Management Inc.\n\nThen there’s volatility — or the lack of it. Short-term implied volatility across major assets has fallen below long-term averages, reaching levels not seen consistently in around four years, according to Cboe Global Markets. It’s a stretch of cross-asset calm that belies the disruption from the shock jobs report just weeks ago. With US growth revised up to 3.3% last quarter, investors have another reason to stay the course.\n\nFor Mandy Xu, this prevailing calm is rooted in the economic story.\n\nStory Continues\n\n“Despite all the tariff chaos, the consumer has held up, inflation is still in check and the Fed is about to cut,” said Xu, Cboe’s head of derivatives market intelligence. “Until that narrative changes, I think volatility is likely to remain in check in the near-term.”\n\nEven a well-supported rally can start to look overconfident, as Friday’s stumble made clear. Still, the S&P 500 ended the week only 0.1% lower, for all the noise. Junk bonds extended gains for a fourth week, as 10-year Treasury yields advanced.\n\n“Having every asset decline simultaneously in terms of volatility is a sign of complacency,” said Peter van Dooijeweert, head of strategic investment partnerships at Capstone Investment Advisors. “The Fed appears to be under severe pressure from the administration and the economic impact of tariffs over the next 12 months is not clear yet. The market seems too relaxed given how much uncertainty remains ahead.”\n\nYet that caution hasn’t translated into investor retreat. Many see this not as ignorance, but a studied surrender to a market that has humbled skeptics all year. Calling it complacency is easy — stepping aside, harder.\n\nCase in point: Data from Barclays Research shows that institutional investors ramped up equity buying in August, led by hedge funds, commodity trading advisors and risk-control funds as volatility collapsed — dubbed an “unusual” re-risking that has pushed overall positioning to above-average levels.\n\n“The only way to spook the market is if interest rates go up or if tech stocks really show a decline in the rate of growth,” said Max Wasserman, co-founder and senior portfolio manager at Miramar Capital. “I am not optimistic about this overall market because it’s dominated by a handful of stocks.”\n\nA dividend-growth investor, Wasserman holds Microsoft Corp., Broadcom Inc. and Alphabet Inc., which together make up about 15% of his portfolio. While his other holdings have been “languishing,” he’s hedging with energy — which he expects to benefit from a weaker dollar — and healthcare.\n\nHis concern isn’t just valuations. It’s crowding.\n\nA similar caution can be heard among credit participants. James St. Aubin, chief investment officer at Ocean Park Asset Management, said he’s holding positions where momentum still looks strong. But with long-term rates proving unpredictable, he’s wary of chasing further gains. “It’s a bad set up for risk taking right now, no matter where you look,” he said. For now, he’s focused on clipping steady income — and staying nimble if conditions shift.\n\nThe strongest and most consistent signals are coming from the riskier corners of credit and equity markets, according to Manish Kabra, chief US equity strategist at SocGen. Crypto assets and cyclical currencies like the Australian dollar and Swedish krona are also flashing green. Commodities — particularly the copper-to-gold ratio and oil — have delivered the most uneven readings.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, some investors are using the calm to rotate — quietly, deliberately — into less obvious corners of the market. At Schwab, Aguilar and his team recently rotated into small caps, betting the segment would benefit most from imminent Fed easing. Earlier this summer, they added exposure to the middle of the fixed-income curve to lock in yield before rates fall. At the start of the year, they shifted into international equities, looking for diversification and upside in regions less tethered to US policy.\n\n“Given that all the activity we have seen this summer, I think the rally is healthy,” he said. But “I would not be surprised if we see a pullback.”\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nMonchhichi Makes a Comeback Amid Labubu Craze As Bushmeat Consumption Grows, Nigerian Doctors Fear Outbreaks Young European Backpackers Are Being Lured to Australia for Mining Jobs How Bombas Built a Fancy Socks Empire With $500 Million in Sales Yosemite Workers Vote to Unionize\n\n©2025 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView Comments",

            "title": "Stocks Settle Lower as Tech Shares Selloff",
            "content": "The S&P 500 Index ($SPX [https://www.barchart.com/futures/quotes/$SPX/overview]) (SPY [https://www.barchart.com/etfs-funds/quotes/SPY/overview]) on Friday closed down by -0.64%, the Dow Jones Industrials Index ($DOWI [https://www.barchart.com/futures/quotes/$DOWI/overview]) (DIA [https://www.barchart.com/etfs-funds/quotes/DIA/overview]) closed down by -0.20%, and the Nasdaq 100 Index ($IUXX [https://www.barchart.com/futures/quotes/$IUXX/overview]) (QQQ [https://www.barchart.com/etfs-funds/quotes/QQQ/overview]) closed down by -1.22%.  September E-mini S&P futures (ESU25 [https://www.barchart.com/futures/quotes/ES*0/overview]) fell -0.68%, and September E-mini Nasdaq futures (NQU25 [https://www.barchart.com/futures/quotes/NQ*0/overview]) fell -1.31%. \n\nStock indexes retreated on Friday, weighed down by weakness in technology stocks.  Marvell Technology tumbled more than -18% to lead semiconductor stocks lower after reporting that Q2 data center revenue missed estimates.  Also, Dell Technologies fell more than -8% to lead computer hardware stocks lower after reporting tighter profit margins on AI servers.   \n\nStocks added to their losses after the August MNI Chicago PMI fell more than expected and after the University of Michigan's US August consumer sentiment index was unexpectedly revised lower.  Also, inflation pressures remain sticky after the US July core PCE price index, the Fed's preferred inflation gauge, rose by the most in five months.\n\nOn the positive side for stocks, US consumer demand remains resilient after July personal spending rose by the most in four months.  Also, the University of Michigan's inflation expectations were unexpectedly revised lower. In addition, dovish comments from Fed Governor Waller and San Francisco Fed President Daly were bullish for stocks as they signaled their support for Fed rate cuts. \n\nUS July personal spending rose +0.5% m/m, the most in four months, and right on expectations.  July personal income rose +0.4% m/m, right on expectations.\n\nThe US July core PCE price index, the Fed's preferred inflation gauge, rose to a 5-month high of +2.9% y/y from +2.8% y/y in June, right on expectations but well above the Fed's 2% inflation target.\n\nThe US Aug MNI Chicago PMI fell -5.6 to 41.5, weaker than expectations of 46.0.\n\nThe University of Michigan's Aug US consumer sentiment index was revised lower by -0.4 to 58.2, weaker than expectations of no change at 58.6.\n\nThe University of Michigan Aug 1-year inflation expectations were unexpectedly revised slightly lower by -0.1 to 4.8%, weaker than expectations of an upward revision to 5.0%. The Aug 5-10 year inflation expectations were revised lower by -0.4 to 3.5% from the previously reported 3.9%.\n\nLate Thursday, Fed Governor Christopher Waller stated that he supports a 25-bp rate cut at the September FOMC meeting and anticipates additional rate cuts over the next three to six months.  He said, \"With underlying inflation close to 2%, market-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations firmly anchored, and the chances of an undesirable weakening in the labor market increased, proper risk management means the FOMC should be cutting the policy rate now.\"\n\nSan Francisco Fed President Mary Daly signaled she's open to lower interest rates soon, saying, \"It will soon be time to recalibrate policy to better match our economy.\" She added that tariff-related price increases \"will be a one-off\" and it \"will take time before we know that for certain, but we can't wait for perfect certainty without risking harm to the labor market.\"\n\nRegarding tariffs, President Trump on Monday threatened to impose new tariffs and export restrictions on advanced technology and semiconductors in retaliation against other nations' digital services taxes that hit American companies.  Last week, Mr. Trump widened steel and aluminum tariffs to include more than 400 consumer items that contain the metals, such as motorcycles, auto parts, furniture components, and tableware.  The change went into effect last Monday and did not exclude goods already in transit.  \n\nIn other recent tariff news, Mr. Trump on August 13 extended the tariff truce with China for another 90 days until November.  On August 6, Mr. Trump announced that he will double tariffs on US imports from India to 50% from the current 25% tariff, due to India's purchases of Russian oil.  According to Bloomberg Economics, the average US tariff will rise to 15.2% if rates are implemented as announced, up from 13.3% earlier, and significantly higher than the 2.3% in 2024 before the tariffs were announced.\n\nFederal funds futures prices are discounting the chances for a -25 bp rate cut at 88% at the next FOMC meeting on September 16-17.  The markets are discounting the chances at 55% for a second -25 bp rate cut at the following meeting on October 28-29.\n\nEarnings reports indicate that S&P 500 earnings for Q2 are on track to rise +9.1% y/y, much better than the pre-season expectations of +2.8% y/y and the most in four years, according to Bloomberg Intelligence.  With Q2 earnings season winding down, over 95% of S&P 500 firms having reported Q2 earnings, about 82% of companies exceeded profit estimates. \n\nOverseas stock markets on Friday settled mixed.  The Euro Stoxx 50 fell to a 2-week low and closed down -0.83%.  China's Shanghai Composite closed up +0.37%.  Japan's Nikkei Stock 225 closed down -0.26.\n\nINTEREST RATES\n\nSeptember 10-year T-notes (ZNU5 [https://www.barchart.com/futures/quotes/ZN*0/overview]) Friday closed down -2.5 ticks, and the 10-year T-note yield rose +2.4 bp to 4.227%. \n\nSep T-notes posted modest losses on Friday after the US July core PCE price index, the Fed's preferred inflation gauge, rose to a 5-month high of +2.9% y/y.  T-notes also have carryover pressure from weakness in 10-year German bunds after the German Aug CPI rose more than expected.\n\nLosses in T-notes were limited after Fed Governor Christopher Waller said he supports a 25 bp rate cut at the September FOMC meeting and anticipates additional rate cuts over the next three to six months.  Also, the University of Michigan's Aug inflation expectations were revised lower, a dovish factor for Fed policy.\n\nEuropean government bond yields on Friday moved higher.  The 10-year German bund yield rose +2.9 bp to 2.724%.  10-year UK gilt yield rose +2.2 bp to 4.722%.\n\nThe ECB's July 1-year CPI expectations remained unchanged from June at +2.6%, which is stronger than the expected +2.5%.  The ECB Jul 3-year CPI expectations unexpectedly climbed to +2.5%, stronger than expectations of no change at +2.4%.\n\nGerman Aug unemployment unexpectedly fell by -9,000, showing a stronger labor market than expectations of +10,000.\n\nGerman Jul retail sales fell -1.5% m/m, weaker than expectations of no change and the biggest decline in almost two years.\n\nGerman Aug CPI (EU harmonized) rose +2.1% y/y, stronger than expectations of +2.0% y/y.\n\nSwaps are discounting the chances at 2% for a -25 bp rate cut by the ECB at the September 11 policy meeting.\n\nUS STOCK MOVERS\n\nChipmakers sold off on Friday, led by an -18% plunge in Marvell Technology (MRVL [https://www.barchart.com/stocks/quotes/MRVL/overview]) to lead losers in the Nasdaq 100

better than the consensus of $1.72 billion, and forecasting Q3 revenue of $180 billion-$1.81 billion, stronger than the consensus of $1.77 billion.\n\nAmbarella (AMBA

Reference actual numbers in your reasoning.\n\n3. **Consistency**: Apply the same scoring standards regardless of the stock. A score of 85 should represent the same quality level across all analyses.\n\n4. **Risk Focus**: Pay special attention to red flags that could invalidate the opportunity (poor liquidity, imminent earnings, deteriorating fundamentals).\n\n5. **Strategy Alignment**: Consider how well this opportunity fits options strategies (directional bias, volatility conditions, time decay considerations).\n\n6. **Completeness Check**: If critical data is missing, note it in your analysis but don't penalize the opportunity excessively for data gaps.\n\nAnalyze the AVGO opportunity now using this framework and respond with the required JSON format.",

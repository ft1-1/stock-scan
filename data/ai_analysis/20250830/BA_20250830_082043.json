            "content": "Carrier Global Corporation (NYSE:CARR) is one of the stocks that Jim Cramer shared insight on. During the lightning round, a caller asked if it was a good time to start a position in the stock. Cramer remarked:\n\n“The stock’s too low. You gotta do some buying. I absolutely, totally agree with you. Hey, by the way… [at] our club meeting today… It was Boeing, and we said go with the Boeing… It was a very good call.”\n\nnicholas-cappello-Wb63zqJ5gnE-unsplash\n\nCarrier Global Corporation (NYSE:CARR) supplies technologies for heating, ventilation, air conditioning (HVAC), refrigeration, fire protection, and security. The company operates across international markets. Over the past year, CARR stock has gone down more than 5%. Moreover, in May, appearing on Squawk on the Street, Cramer commented:\n\n“And David Gitlin, Carrier, HVAC, they moved very aggressively into the data center. And ever since they moved into the data center, every one of those stocks has been crushed. But that maybe coincidental, maybe not.”\n\nAdditionally, in October 2024, discussing the company, Cramer remarked:\n\n“There was a time when people seemed to ignore the success of David Gitlin at Carrier. Not anymore, you can’t. The stock’s getting its due. It’s now had such a big run that this climate control player may not pop on the earnings numbers, but I sure think they’re going to be strong.”\n\nWhile we acknowledge the potential of CARR as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.

And I said, well, I like Boeing… And I like Boeing, too.”\n\nPixabay/Public Domain\n\nThe Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) designs, manufactures, and markets a range of products that include commercial aircraft, military jets, satellites, missile defense systems, and space-focused programs. On July 29, Cramer was bullish on the stock as he commented:\n\n“Now, I felt the same way about Boeing. Now, here’s a stock that just hit a 52-week high after giving you almost a double from its low in April. Thank you, Kelly Ortberg. And even though it reported a great quarter with beautiful cash flow, the stock still got hit today. But unlike all the others, just call me a buyer of that one.”\n\nWhile we acknowledge the potential of BA as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.

            "content": "Allegiant Travel Company ALGT recently reported encouraging traffic numbers for July 2025.\n\nScheduled traffic (measured in revenue passenger miles) rose 10.3% from the July 2024 levels. Capacity (measured in available seat miles) for scheduled service rose 11.5% year over year. Although traffic improved on a year-over-year basis, it failed to outpace capacity expansion. As a result, the load factor (percentage of seats filled by passengers) in July 2025 declined to 86.6% from 87.5% a year ago.\n\nTotal departures (scheduled services) grew 11.8% in July 2025 from a year ago. However, its average stage length (miles) fell 0.4%.\n\nFor the total system (including scheduled service and fixed fee contract), Allegiant carried 10.1% more passengers in July 2025 than in the year-ago period. System-wide capacity improved 10.8% in July 2025 on a year-over-year basis.\n\nThe fuel price per gallon in July 2025 is estimated to have been $2.58.\n\nAllegiant currently carries a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).\n\nYou can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nJuly 2025 Traffic of Other Airline Companies\n\nApart from Allegiant, other airline companies that have reported traffic numbers for July 2025 are LATAM Airlines Group (LTM) and Ryanair Holdings RYAAY.\n\nLATAM Airlines\n\nLATAM Airlines reported a year-over-year increase in revenue passenger-kilometers (RPK: a measure of air traffic) for July 2025.\n\nLATAM Airlines reported a 10% year-over-year increase in consolidated capacity, measured in available seat-kilometers (ASK). The uptick was driven by a 12.2% increase in the group’s international operations and an 11.8% increase in the domestic operations of LATAM Airlines Brazil.\n\nLTM’s consolidated traffic, measured in revenue passenger-kilometers (RPK), increased 10.4% year over year. As traffic outpaced capacity expansion, the consolidated load factor (percentage of seats filled by passengers) grew by 0.4 percentage points from July 2024 to 86.7% in July 2025, maintaining healthy load factors across all business segments.\n\nDuring the month, LATAM Airlinestransported almost 8 million passengers, an increase of 7.9% year over year. Year to date, LATAM Airlines has transported 49.5 million passengers across its network.\n\nRyanair Holdings\n\nEuropean carrier, Ryanair, reported solid traffic numbers for July 2025, driven by upbeat air-travel demand. The number of passengers transported on Ryanair flights was 20.7 million in July 2025, reflecting a 3% year-over-year increase.\n\nApart from a year-over-year surge, RYAAY’s July traffic also reflects a straight seven-month improvement at a stretch from the beginning of 2025. RYAAY’s July traffic was higher than the June reading of 19.9 million, the May reading of 19.6 million, the April reading of 18.3 million, the March reading of 15 million, the February reading of 12.6 million and the January reading of 12.4 million.\n\nStory Continues\n\nThe July load factor of 96% remained flat on a year-over-year basis, reflecting consistent passenger demand for the airline's services. The July load factor of 96% was higher than the load factor of 95% reported in June and May, the load factor of 93% reported in April and March, the load factor of 92% reported in February 2025 and 91% reported in January 2025.\n\nAlthough 680 flights were canceled due to the French air traffic control strikes, RYAAY operated more than 113,000 flights in July 2025. This marks an improvement from 109,000 flights operated in June 2025, 108,000 flights operated in May 2025, 103,000 flights in April 2025, 84,000 flights in March 2025, and 71,360 flights in February 2025. In January 2025, growth at RYAAY was hampered by 38 delayed Boeing BA deliveries.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

These ''units'' can be traded back and forth just like stocks, but can also be created or destroyed to accommodate investor demand.  Each week we monitor the week-over-week change in shares outstanding data, to keep a lookout for those ETFs experiencing notable inflows (many new units created) or outflows (many old units destroyed).

            "content": "Atlas Air on Thursday said it has been enlisted by Etihad Airways and DSV, the largest pure-play logistics provider in the world by revenue, to provide dedicated freighter aircraft and crews for their burgeoning airfreight requirements.\n\nEtihad Airlines, which operates five Boeing 777 freighter aircraft in addition to a large fleet of widebody passenger aircraft, has signed a dedicated contract with New York-based Atlas Air to supply and fly a Boeing 777 freighter between Hong Hong, Abu Dhabi and Madrid, Spain, beginning in August.\n\nThe announcement didn’t indicate the frequency of service, but the default position is likely once per week. Atlas Air said the 777 is a newly delivered production aircraft from Boeing.\n\nIn June, Etihad’s cargo division similarly wet leased a Boeing 747-400 freighter from U.S.-based Western Global Airlines to support new service to London and Shenzhen, China.\n\nAtlas Air has previously provided dedicated transport service for Etihad Cargo. The airline is the world’s largest operator of Boeing 747 freighters.\n\n“Etihad Cargo’s expanded collaboration with Atlas Air represents a strategic step in scaling capacity and extending our global reach,” said Stanislas Brun, Etihad’s chief cargo officer. “With Etihad Airways’ passenger fleet continuing to grow, it is essential that our freighter fleet expands in parallel to sustain this momentum and deliver end-to-end network connectivity. By aligning growth across both passenger and freighter operations, Etihad Cargo reinforces its ability to meet evolving customer demand, strengthen high-volume trade lanes and introduce greater flexibility across key markets.”\n\nAtlas Air also said that DSV has expanded its partnership by signing a long-term charter agreement giving it commercial control of a Boeing 777-200 freighter. Atlas Air will operate the aircraft on transcontinental routes, including via DSV’s main U.S. hub in Huntsville, Alabama, and Luxembourg.\n\nAtlas Air has a long-standing relationship with DSV. At various times it has operated Boeing 747 jumbo jets from Asia to Huntsville and Phoenix, and between Miami and Sao Paulo, Brazil, on DSV’s behalf.\n\n“The addition of a 777 freighter allows us to further enhance service to our customers, with greater control over capacity, schedules, and connectivity. The Huntsville–Luxembourg corridor is a vital trade lane for us, and this new program ensures we can continue to deliver consistent, high-quality performance across key transcontinental routes,” said Stefan Krikken, senior vice president at DSV.\n\nBoth Atlas 777 aircraft are newly delivered production freighters from Boeing. The planes offer a maximum payload of 103 tons and range of nearly 5,000 miles. Atlas Air currently operates four newbuild 777-200s for Europe-based MSC Air Cargo.\n\nStory Continues\n\nClick here for more FreightWaves/American Shipper stories by Eric Kulisch.\n\nWrite to Eric Kulisch at ekulisch@freightwaves.com.\n\nRELATED STORIES:\n\nSchenker sale to DSV approved\n\nEtihad Airways hires 747 operate Western Global to expand cargo service\n\nThe post Etihad Airways, DSV sign Atlas Air for dedicated 777 capacity appeared first on FreightWaves.\n\nView Comments",

            "content": "Cameco Corp (NYSE:CCJ [https://www.chartmill.com/stock/quote/CCJ]) appears as a notable candidate for investors using a high growth momentum strategy blended with technical breakout analysis. This method focuses on companies showing strong earnings acceleration, solid sales growth, and positive analyst revisions, key traits of the ChartMill High Growth Momentum Rating, while also displaying good technical condition and consolidation patterns that suggest possible breakout chances. The method successfully combines fundamental growth traits with accurate technical entry points, seeking to identify stocks ready for large upward moves.\n\n[Cameco Corp]\n\nFUNDAMENTAL GROWTH MOMENTUM Cameco’s fundamental profile matches well with the standards valued by high growth momentum investors. The company shows outstanding quarterly earnings growth, with the latest quarter revealing a remarkable 407.14% year-over-year rise in EPS. This speed is important for momentum strategies, as it frequently comes before continued positive price performance. Revenue growth stays solid at 46.66% for the same period, showing good underlying demand for uranium and nuclear services. Also, free cash flow per share has jumped by 377.75% over the last year, highlighting better financial condition and operational effectiveness. Analyst opinion has become clearly positive, with next-year EPS estimates adjusted higher by 21.04% over the past three months, showing increasing belief in Cameco’s short-term future. These parts together add to its High Growth Momentum Rating of 6, showing a firm, though not flawless, mix of growth, speed, and outside confirmation.\n\nTECHNICAL STRENGTH AND SETUP QUALITY From a technical viewpoint, Cameco offers an equally notable case. The stock has a perfect Technical Rating of 10, showing better relative strength, a good long-term trend, and steady outperformance against both industry competitors and wider market indices. It is now trading near its 52-week high, having gained 92.53% over the past year, and shows good momentum across various timeframes. More significantly, the Setup Rating of 8 points to a clear consolidation pattern, indicating the stock might be getting ready for a breakout. The technical review finds a defined resistance area around $79.60,$79.92; a clear move above this point could mark the next step upward. Support is strongly set near $74.84,$75.42, giving a sensible level for stop-loss orders to control risk. This blend of technical strength and a high-grade setup is vital for timing entries well, lowering the chance of buying during stretched or overbought situations.\n\nSTRATEGIC IMPLICATIONS AND EXECUTION For investors tracking high growth momentum strategies, Cameco stands for an uncommon meeting of fundamental energy and technical accuracy. The company’s connection to the growing nuclear energy sector, fueled by worldwide moves toward clean and dependable electricity, offers a macroeconomic boost that supports its strong financial and technical measures. The stock’s high liquidity, with average daily volume over 4.6 million shares, further increases its appeal by providing simple entry and exit. Traders and investors thinking about a position might consider entering on a breakout above the $79.92 resistance level, with a stop loss set below the closest support area to restrict downside risk. This careful method fits with the central ideas of momentum investing, where the aim is to join in strong trends while wisely controlling risk.\n\nFor those wanting to look into similar chances, other high growth momentum stocks with good technical setups can be examined using this specialized screen [https://www.chartmill.com/stock/stock-screener?sid=719&f=v1_50b500,atrpct_a_1,sl_ta_7_X,sl_se_7_X,p_pg20,exch_us,sl_ratingHgm_6_X&s=se&v=3].\n\n_Disclaimer: This article is for informational purposes only and does not constitute investment advice.

            "content": "SASKATOON, SK, Aug. 29, 2025 /CNW/ - Cameco Corporation and Orano Canada Inc. have signed a landmark 15-year agreement, worth approximately $500 million, with Rise Air, an Indigenous-owned airline, to provide workforce transportation services for northern Saskatchewan operations.Cameco and Orano sign historic 15-year agreement with Indigenous-owned Rise Air (CNW Group/Rise Air)\n\nThis long-term partnership represents the most significant commitment to date between the companies, building on a relationship that began in 1993 with Orano (then COGEMA) and shortly after with Cameco. Previous agreements with Rise Air have typically spanned three years or less.\n\n\"Securing a 15-year agreement is truly transformative for Rise Air,\" said Derek Nice, CEO of Rise Air. \"It means we can plan for the future with confidence — investing in modern equipment, upgrading our facilities, and expanding hiring and training. Most importantly, it allows us to focus on building long-term careers for residents of northern Saskatchewan.\"\n\nThe agreement underscores Cameco's and Orano's confidence in Rise Air as the right partner to meet their workforce transportation needs, which are essential to continued growth in the north.\n\n\"We are proud to continue our long-standing relationship with Rise Air, a business owned by the Indigenous communities in the Athabasca Basin and dedicated to serving the North. Air transportation is critical to our operations in northern Saskatchewan. Without the ability to fly workers to our remote sites, we cannot operate. This contract ensures continued access to our sites through an exciting new fleet of aircraft. We are jointly committing to a long-term, mutually beneficial partnership focused on providing safe, reliable transportation for our workforce,\" said Tim Gitzel, president and CEO of Cameco.\n\nOrano Canada is committed to maintaining successful operations in northern Saskatchewan, and that is not possible without strong, reliable partnerships in the supply chain.\n\n\"For years we have entrusted Rise Air to support our northern mines by safely moving our most precious resource: our people,\" said Jim Corman, President and CEO of Orano Canada. \"The renewal of this longstanding partnership through the signing of a new contract signifies our confidence in Rise Air and our commitment to continuing to work together, as we prepare for the bright future ahead for the Saskatchewan uranium industry.\"\n\nAs Saskatchewan's largest regional airline, Rise Air plays a vital role in connecting northern communities and supporting regional economic development. This new agreement ensures stability, growth, and continued collaboration for decades to come.\n\nStory continues\n\n\"Cameco and Orano have been partners for our communities and for our regional airline for many years,\" says Coreen Sayazie, Chief of Black Lake First Nation. \"All three of these companies provide job opportunities and economic benefits into the north.  By signing this 15-year agreement, it demonstrates a continued long-term investment, and as both a community leader and a community member, I am happy to see this type of long-term commitment formalized in this way.\"\n\nRise Air is 100% Indigenous owned, with Athabasca Basin Development and Prince Albert Development Corp as owners. The ownership collectively impacts 12 First Nations and four municipalities.\n\n\"As an investor in Rise Air, Prince Albert Development Corporation is pleased to see this agreement take place,\" says Vice Chief Joseph Tsannie, Prince Albert Grand Council. \"All three companies have demonstrated a commitment to investing in our people through creative initiatives such as the Dziret'ai Pilot Training Program. Signing this agreement today is the next phase in what has been an ongoing example of companies working together with our northern communities and investing in the north. We greatly appreciate the relationship with Cameco and Orano over many years and look forward to many more to come.\"\n\n\"Athabasca Basin Development (ABD) has been working together with Cameco and Orano since ABD started over twenty years ago,\" says Anne Robillard, Chair of Athabasca Basin Development. \"They are both valued partners for many of our investments, and Rise Air is one of them. A 15-year commitment like this helps our companies plan important things like workforce training and strengthens one of our largest investments. When our investments are strong, it helps improve service and build wealth for our communities – a huge win for the Athabasca.\"\n\nAbout Cameco Corporation\n\nCameco is one of the largest global providers of the uranium fuel needed to power a secure energy future.

            "content": "In recent days, Uranium Energy ramped up production at its ISR mines and advanced U.S.-focused uranium projects, while sector peer Cameco reported very large gains in uranium revenues and earnings. This increased activity aligns with a push for U.S. nuclear fuel independence, drawing market attention despite analyst concerns over Uranium Energy’s near-term earnings outlook. We'll now explore how Uranium Energy’s progress toward domestic uranium production influences its investment narrative amid sector momentum.\n\nThis technology could replace computers: discover 23 stocks that are working to make quantum computing a reality.\n\nWhat Is Uranium Energy's Investment Narrative?\n\nFor anyone considering Uranium Energy, a key belief is that domestic uranium production is at a major turning point, with current U.S. policy momentum driving renewed interest in local supply chains. Recent news of ramped-up production at key ISR mines and progress at projects like Sweetwater fit squarely into this narrative, positioning the company to benefit if U.S. nuclear fuel independence efforts are sustained. However, this push hasn’t translated into visible near-term financial improvement so far, the company recently experienced a sharper share price drop than the broader market, following persistent net losses and no expected change in EPS for the coming quarter. This has shifted the spotlight onto rising operating costs and the challenge of bridging ambitions for production growth with a viable path to profitability, amplifying risks that were already present but now feel more immediate following the latest updates. Catalysts remain largely unchanged, centering on further regulatory wins and any breakthroughs in long-term offtake or partnership agreements. Yet, the market’s swift reaction to recent results signals a heightened sensitivity to financial progress, or lack thereof, from here. \r\n Yet, short-term earnings risks are even more important for investors to keep in mind.\n\nUranium Energy's shares have been on the rise but are still potentially undervalued.

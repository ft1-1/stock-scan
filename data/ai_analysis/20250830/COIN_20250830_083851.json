            "content": "Benzinga and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue on some items through the links below.\n\nInfluential investor Kevin O’Leary shared his observations on Gen Zs investment habits on Thursday, highlighting their interest in cryptocurrencies alongside traditional stocks.\n\nGen Zs Have It Easy, Says ‘Mr. Wonderful’\n\nO'Leary took to X, sharing a clip from his recent interview with Fox Business, where he noted how the younger generation is now purchasing Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) and Ethereum (CRYPTO: ETH) on platforms such as Robinhood, along with stocks, a trend not seen when he began investing.\n\n“And they just look at, you know, these other investment opportunities as, as having the same merit that a stock does, or a bond,” O'Leary, nicknamed \"Mr Wonderful,\" said.\n\nTrending: 40% of Americans Want a Vacation Home — This Startup Found a Way to Make It Possible (and Profitable)\n\nHe also mentioned the emergence of AI-driven investment apps that simplify the investment process for novices, specifically mentioning Beanstox, which he co-founded.\n\nO’Leary recalled an incident in which a young man who had sold him a watch asked for payment in stablecoins.\n\nZoomers More Receptive Toward Crypto?\n\nNotably, 75% of Gen Z stablecoin users said in a recent survey that they would prefer to receive their salary in stablecoins, emerging as the most committed demographic. The survey also revealed that nearly half of Gen Z users make monthly stablecoin transactions, outpacing both Millennials and Gen X.\n\nA February report on U.S. investment trends said that Gen Z is more likely than any other demographic to invest in cryptocurrencies in 2025, even though they’re aware of the risks.\n\nSee Also: Dump Your Financial Advisors.

You can invest today for just $0.30/share. If there was a new fund backed by Jeff Bezos offering a 7-9% target yield with monthly dividends would you invest in it?\n\nBuilding Wealth Across More Than Just the Market\n\nBuilding a resilient portfolio means thinking beyond a single asset or market trend. Economic cycles shift, sectors rise and fall, and no one investment performs well in every environment. That's why many investors look to diversify with platforms that provide access to real estate, fixed-income opportunities, professional financial guidance, precious metals, and even self-directed retirement accounts. By spreading exposure across multiple asset classes, it becomes easier to manage risk, capture steady returns, and create long-term wealth that isn't tied to the fortunes of just one company or industry.\n\nArrived Homes\n\nBacked by Jeff Bezos, Arrived Homes makes real estate investing accessible with a low barrier to entry. Investors can buy fractional shares of single-family rentals and vacation homes starting with as little as $100. This allows everyday investors to diversify into real estate, collect rental income, and build long-term wealth without needing to manage properties directly.\n\nWorthy Bonds\n\nFor those seeking fixed-income style returns without Wall Street complexity, Worthy Bonds offers SEC-qualified, interest-bearing bonds starting at just $10. Investors earn a fixed 7% annual return, with funds deployed to small U.S. businesses. The bonds are fully liquid, meaning you can cash out anytime, making them attractive for conservative investors looking for steady, passive income.\n\nIRA Financial\n\nSelf-directed investors looking to take greater control of their retirement savings may consider IRA Financial. The platform enables you to use a self-directed IRA or Solo 401(k) to invest in alternative assets such as real estate, private equity, or even crypto. This flexibility empowers retirement savers to go beyond traditional stocks and bonds, building diversified portfolios that align with their long-term wealth strategies.\n\nWiserAdvisor\n\nWiserAdvisor makes it easier to find a financial advisor who fits your needs. The platform matches you with vetted professionals based on your goals and investable assets, with a focus on those who have at least $100,000 to put to work. By comparing advisors through WiserAdvisor, investors can identify someone who aligns with their risk tolerance, retirement plans, and broader wealth strategy.\n\nAmerican Hartford Gold\n\nFor investors concerned about inflation or seeking portfolio protection, American Hartford Gold provides a simple way to buy and hold physical gold and silver within an IRA or direct delivery. With a minimum investment of $10,000, the platform caters to those looking to preserve wealth through precious metals while maintaining the option to diversify retirement accounts. It's a favored choice for conservative investors who want tangible assets that historically hold value during uncertain markets.\n\nThis article Kevin O'Leary Says Gen Zs Invest in Bitcoin, Ethereum Alongside Stocks, A Chance He Never Had Early in His Investment Journey originally appeared on Benzinga.com\n\nView Comments",

and after the University of Michigan's US August consumer sentiment index was unexpectedly revised lower.  Also, inflation pressures remain sticky after the US July core PCE price index, the Fed's preferred inflation gauge, rose by the most in five months.\n\nOn the positive side for stocks, US consumer demand remains resilient after July personal spending rose by the most in four months.  Also, the University of Michigan's inflation expectations were unexpectedly revised lower. In addition, dovish comments from Fed Governor Waller and San Francisco Fed President Daly were bullish for stocks as they signaled their support for Fed rate cuts.\n\nUS July personal spending rose +0.5% m/m, the most in four months, and right on expectations.  July personal income rose +0.4% m/m, right on expectations.\n\nThe US July core PCE price index, the Fed's preferred inflation gauge, rose to a 5-month high of +2.9% y/y from +2.8% y/y in June, right on expectations but well above the Fed's 2%

upward revision to 5.0%. The Aug 5-10 year inflation expectations were revised lower by -0.4 to 3.5% from the previously reported 3.9%.\n\nLate Thursday, Fed Governor Christopher Waller stated that he supports a 25-bp rate cut at the September FOMC meeting and anticipates additional rate cuts over the next three to six months.  He said, \"With underlying inflation close to 2%, market-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations firmly anchored, and the chances of an undesirable weakening in the labor market increased, proper risk management means the FOMC should be cutting the policy rate now.\"\n\nSan Francisco Fed President Mary Daly signaled she's open to lower interest rates soon, saying, \"It will soon be time to recalibrate policy to better match our economy.\" She added that tariff-related price increases \"will be a one-off\" and it \"will take time before we know that for certain, but we can't wait for perfect certainty without risking harm to the labor market.\"\n\nRegarding tariffs, President Trump on Monday threatened to impose new tariffs and export restrictions on advanced technology and semiconductors in retaliation against other nations' digital services taxes that hit American companies.  Last week, Mr. Trump widened steel and aluminum tariffs to include more than 400 consumer items that contain the metals, such as motorcycles, auto parts, furniture components, and tableware.  The change went into effect last Monday and did not exclude goods already in transit.\n\nIn other recent tariff news, Mr. Trump on August 13 extended the tariff truce with China for another 90 days until November.  On August 6, Mr. Trump announced that he will double tariffs on US imports from India to 50% from the current 25% tariff, due to India's purchases of Russian oil.  According to Bloomberg Economics, the average US tariff will rise to 15.2% if rates are implemented as announced, up from 13.3% earlier, and significantly higher than the 2.3% in 2024 before the tariffs were announced.\n\nFederal funds futures prices are discounting the chances for a -25 bp rate cut at 88% at the next FOMC meeting on September 16-17.  The markets are discounting the chances at 55% for a second -25 bp rate cut at the following meeting on October 28-29.\n\nEarnings reports indicate that S&P 500 earnings for Q2 are on track to rise +9.1% y/y, much better than the pre-season expectations of +2.8% y/y and the most in four years, according to Bloomberg Intelligence.  With Q2 earnings season winding down, over 95% of S&P 500 firms having reported Q2 earnings, about 82% of companies exceeded profit estimates.\n\nOverseas stock markets on Friday settled mixed.  The Euro Stoxx 50 fell to a 2-week low and closed down -0.83%.  China's Shanghai Composite closed up +0.37%.  Japan's Nikkei Stock 225 closed down -0.26.\n\nInterest Rates\n\nSeptember 10-year T-notes (ZNU5) Friday closed down -2.5 ticks, and the 10-year T-note yield rose +2.4 bp to 4.227%.\n\nSep T-notes posted modest losses on Friday after the US July core PCE price index, the Fed's preferred inflation gauge, rose to a 5-month high of +2.9% y/y.  T-notes also have carryover pressure from weakness in 10-year German bunds after the German Aug CPI rose more than expected.\n\nLosses in T-notes were limited after Fed Governor Christopher Waller said he supports a 25 bp rate cut at the September FOMC meeting and anticipates additional rate cuts over the next three to six months.  Also, the University of Michigan's Aug inflation expectations were revised lower, a dovish factor for Fed policy.\n\nEuropean government bond yields on Friday moved higher.  The 10-year German bund yield rose +2.9 bp to 2.724%.  10-year UK gilt yield rose +2.2 bp to 4.722%.\n\nThe ECB's

weaker than expectations of no change and the biggest decline in almost two years.\n\nGerman Aug CPI (EU harmonized) rose +2.1% y/y, stronger than expectations of +2.0% y/y.\n\nSwaps are discounting the chances at 2% for a -25 bp rate cut by the ECB at the September 11 policy meeting.\n\nUS Stock Movers\n\nChipmakers sold off on Friday, led by an -18% plunge in Marvell Technology (MRVL) to lead

Reference actual numbers in your reasoning.\n\n3. **Consistency**: Apply the same scoring standards regardless of the stock. A score of 85 should represent the same quality level across all analyses.\n\n4. **Risk Focus**: Pay special attention to red flags that could invalidate the opportunity (poor liquidity, imminent earnings, deteriorating fundamentals).\n\n5. **Strategy Alignment**: Consider how well this opportunity fits options strategies (directional bias, volatility conditions, time decay considerations).\n\n6. **Completeness Check**: If critical data is missing, note it in your analysis but don't penalize the opportunity excessively for data gaps.\n\nAnalyze the COIN opportunity now using this framework and respond with the required JSON format.",

            "content": "NEW YORK, August 29, 2025--(BUSINESS WIRE)--The quest for exceptional rarity. Introducing Tilda Swinton for the new TOM FORD Black Orchid Reserve campaign.\n\n\"It is a profound honour for me to play a part in the history of TOM FORD’s legendary Black Orchid. Transformation, the blurring of boundaries and the celebration of magical properties have always drawn me close; Black Orchid Reserve is precisely such an enchantment.\" — Tilda Swinton\n\nA celebrated actor and artist, Swinton is a singular presence known for her fearless artistry and transformative performances. An Academy Award, BAFTA and Golden Lion for Lifetime Achievement winner, Swinton defies conventions with elegance, intellect and a visionary approach to cinema. Her work transcends definition, shaping the culture through work in film, art and performance.\n\nTOM FORD creative director Haider Ackermann designed the campaign as a cinematic portrait of rarity in its most heightened form. Lensed by Inez and Vinoodh, the campaign images and video — launching on September 1 — show Swinton in fluid motion. A magnetic force of nature. It is a portrait of a woman who awakens the world around her through gaze and gesture, stillness and strength. She is as rare as the Black Orchid – a flower born of the quest for perfection.\n\nBlack Orchid, TOM FORD’s first fragrance, was a revelation when it debuted in 2006. Now, TOM FORD debuts Black Orchid Reserve. The fragrance introduces the Ghost Orchid — a phantom-like flower that is revered as one of the most elusive in the world — with its scent captured by headspace technology the moment the Ghost Orchid blooms. This precious note is a decadent white floral, providing a brilliant contrast to Black Orchid’s rich, dark accords and spice, ushering in a new chapter in the world of TOM FORD’s Black Orchid.\n\nABOUT TOM FORD\n\nTOM FORD IS A GLOBAL LUXURY HOUSE OFFERING EXCEPTIONAL WOMEN’S AND MEN’S FASHION, ACCESSORIES, EYEWEAR AND BEAUTY.\n\nFOUNDED IN 2005 BY TOM FORD, THE HOUSE IS KNOWN FOR SHARP TAILORING AND SEDUCTIVE ELEGANCE.

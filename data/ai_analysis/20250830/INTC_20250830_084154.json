            "content": "The S&P 500 Index ($SPX) (SPY) on Friday closed down by -0.64%, the Dow Jones Industrials Index ($DOWI) (DIA) closed down by -0.20%, and the Nasdaq 100 Index ($IUXX) (QQQ) closed down by -1.22%.  September E-mini S&P futures (ESU25) fell -0.68%, and September E-mini Nasdaq futures (NQU25) fell -1.31%.\n\nStock indexes retreated on Friday, weighed down by weakness in technology stocks.  Marvell Technology tumbled more than -18% to lead semiconductor stocks lower after reporting that Q2 data center revenue missed estimates.  Also, Dell Technologies fell more than -8% to lead computer hardware stocks lower after reporting tighter profit margins on AI servers. Join 200K+ Subscribers: Find out why the midday Barchart Brief newsletter is a must-read for thousands daily.\n\nStocks added to their losses after the August MNI Chicago PMI fell more than expected and after the University of Michigan's US August consumer sentiment index was unexpectedly revised lower.  Also, inflation pressures remain sticky after the US July core PCE price index, the Fed's preferred inflation gauge, rose by the most in five months.\n\nOn the positive side for stocks, US consumer demand remains resilient after July personal spending rose by the most in four months.  Also, the University of Michigan's inflation expectations were unexpectedly revised lower. In addition, dovish comments from Fed Governor Waller and San Francisco Fed President Daly were bullish for stocks as they signaled their support for Fed rate cuts.\n\nUS July personal spending rose +0.5% m/m, the most in four months, and right on expectations.  July personal income rose +0.4% m/m, right on expectations.\n\nThe US July core PCE price index, the Fed's preferred inflation gauge, rose to a 5-month high of +2.9% y/y from +2.8% y/y in June, right on expectations but well above the Fed's 2% inflation target.\n\nThe US Aug MNI Chicago PMI fell -5.6 to 41.5, weaker than expectations of 46.0.\n\nThe University of Michigan's Aug US consumer sentiment index was revised lower by -0.4 to 58.2, weaker than expectations of no change at 58.6.\n\nThe University of Michigan Aug 1-year inflation expectations were unexpectedly revised slightly lower by -0.1 to 4.8%, weaker than expectations of an upward revision to 5.0%. The Aug 5-10 year inflation expectations were revised lower by -0.4 to 3.5% from the previously reported 3.9%.\n\nLate Thursday, Fed Governor Christopher Waller stated that he supports a 25-bp rate cut at the September FOMC meeting and anticipates additional rate cuts over the next three to six months.  He said, \"With underlying inflation close to 2%, market-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations firmly anchored, and the chances of an undesirable weakening in the labor market increased, proper risk management means the FOMC should be cutting the policy rate now.\"\n\nSan Francisco Fed President Mary Daly signaled she's open to lower interest rates soon, saying, \"It will soon be time to recalibrate policy to better match our economy.\" She added that tariff-related price increases \"will be a one-off\" and it \"will take time before we know that for certain, but we can't wait for perfect certainty without risking harm to the labor market.\"\n\nRegarding tariffs, President Trump on Monday threatened to impose new tariffs and export restrictions on advanced technology and semiconductors in retaliation against other nations' digital services taxes that hit American companies.  Last week, Mr. Trump widened steel and aluminum tariffs to include more than 400 consumer items that contain the metals, such as motorcycles, auto parts, furniture components, and tableware.  The change went into effect last Monday and did not exclude goods already in transit.\n\nIn other recent tariff news, Mr. Trump on August 13 extended the tariff truce with China for another 90 days until November.  On August 6, Mr. Trump announced that he will double tariffs on US imports from India to 50% from the current 25% tariff, due to India's purchases of Russian oil.  According to Bloomberg Economics, the average US tariff will rise to 15.2% if rates are implemented as announced, up from 13.3% earlier, and significantly higher than the 2.3% in 2024 before the tariffs were announced.\n\nFederal funds futures prices are discounting the chances for a -25 bp rate cut at 88% at the next FOMC meeting on September 16-17.  The markets are discounting the chances at 55% for a second -25 bp rate cut at the following meeting on October 28-29.\n\nEarnings reports indicate that S&P 500 earnings for Q2 are on track to rise +9.1% y/y, much better than the pre-season expectations of +2.8% y/y and the most in four years, according to Bloomberg Intelligence.  With Q2 earnings season winding down, over 95% of S&P 500 firms having reported Q2 earnings, about 82% of companies exceeded profit estimates.\n\nOverseas stock markets on Friday settled mixed.  The Euro Stoxx 50 fell to a 2-week low and closed down -0.83%.  China's Shanghai Composite closed up +0.37%.  Japan's Nikkei Stock 225 closed down -0.26.\n\nInterest Rates\n\nSeptember 10-year T-notes (ZNU5) Friday closed down -2.5 ticks, and the 10-year T-note yield rose +2.4 bp to 4.227%.\n\nSep T-notes posted modest losses on Friday after the US July core PCE price index, the Fed's preferred inflation gauge, rose to a 5-month high of +2.9% y/y.  T-notes also have carryover pressure from weakness in 10-year German bunds after the German Aug CPI rose more than expected.\n\nLosses in T-notes were limited after Fed Governor Christopher Waller said he supports a 25 bp rate cut at the September FOMC meeting and anticipates additional rate cuts over the next three to six months.  Also, the University of Michigan's Aug inflation expectations were revised lower, a dovish factor for Fed policy.\n\nEuropean government bond yields on Friday moved higher.  The 10-year German bund yield rose +2.9 bp to 2.724%.  10-year UK gilt yield rose +2.2 bp to 4.722%.\n\nThe ECB's July 1-year CPI expectations remained unchanged from June at +2.6%, which is stronger than the expected +2.5%.  The ECB Jul 3-year CPI expectations unexpectedly climbed to +2.5%, stronger than expectations of no change at +2.4%.\n\nGerman Aug unemployment unexpectedly fell by -9,000, showing a stronger labor market than expectations of +10,000.\n\nGerman Jul retail sales fell -1.5% m/m, weaker than expectations of no change and the biggest decline in almost two years.\n\nGerman Aug CPI (EU harmonized) rose +2.1% y/y, stronger than expectations of +2.0% y/y.\n\nSwaps are discounting the chances at 2% for a -25 bp rate cut by the ECB at the September 11 policy meeting.\n\nUS Stock Movers\n\nChipmakers sold off on Friday, led by an -18% plunge in Marvell Technology (MRVL) to lead losers in the Nasdaq 100 after it reported Q2 data center revenue of $1.49 billion, below the consensus of $1.52 billion.  Also, Lam Research (LRCX) closed down more than -4%, and Broadcom (AVGO),

this year.\n\nDollar General (DG) closed down more than -2% despite reporting better-than-expected Q2 EPS after it said it expects \"more pressure\" in selling, general, and administrative (SG&A)

            "content": "This article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nAfter months of silence on chip policy, the Trump administration just fired a precision missile at China's semiconductor lifeline. Washington is revoking key export waivers that allowed Samsung Electronics (SSNLF), SK Hynix, and an Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) unit to freely import US chipmaking gear into their Chinese fabs. These so-called VEU (validated end user) exemptionsquietly maintained since 2023gave the firms room to operate without fresh licensing hurdles. Now, with just 120 days left on the clock, that runway is vanishing fast.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 10 Warning Signs with INTC. Is INTC fairly valued? Test your thesis with our free DCF calculator.\n\nSamsung and SK Hynix have the most to lose. Both South Korean giants rely on China not just as a marketbut as a manufacturing base. Massive swaths of their DRAM and NAND output come from facilities inside China's borders. Those chips are essential to everything from smartphones to consumer gadgets built on the mainland. When the Biden administration extended these waivers last year, it was a lifeline. Now, with the plug pulled, those fabs face a bureaucratic thicket of license approvals just to keep humming.\n\nWhat's next? The US is leaving the door opentechnicallyby allowing companies to apply for new licenses. But with geopolitics sharpening by the week, investors shouldn't count on business as usual. Intel, Samsung, and SK Hynix haven't commented publicly yet. But the signal from Washington is loud: even the world's largest chipmakers are no longer insulated from the frontlines of the US-China tech war. The memory chip supply chain just got a lot more fragile\n\nKommentare anzeigen",

            "content": "(Reuters) -Intel said on Friday it amended the CHIPS Act funding deal with the U.S. Department of Commerce to remove earlier project milestones and received about $5.7 billion in cash sooner than planned.\n\nThe move will give Intel more flexibility over the funds.\n\nThe amended agreement, which revises a November 2024 funding deal, retains some guardrails that prevent the chipmaker from using the funds for dividends and buybacks, doing certain control-changing deals and from expanding in certain countries.\n\nAs part of the deal, Intel issued the U.S. government 274.6 million shares and promised the government the option to buy up to 240.5 million more shares under certain conditions.\n\nIntel said it has set aside 158.7 million shares in an escrow account to be released after the government makes available more CHIPS funds for the Secure Enclave program, designed to expand advanced chips manufacturing.\n\nThe company also said it has spent at least $7.87 billion on eligible CHIPS Act-funded projects.\n\nThe U.S. government's move to take a 9.9% equity stake in Intel sparked questions about the outlook for corporate America after President Donald Trump said he plans to do other similar deals.\n\nThe government's $8.9 billion investment is in addition to the $2.2 billion in grants Intel has previously received, making for a total investment of $11.1 billion, the company has said.\n\nThe Intel stake, announced by the U.S. government last week, is an incentive for the chipmaker to retain control of its contract manufacturing business, or foundry, Intel's finance chief David Zinsner said at an investor conference on Thursday.\n\n(Reporting by Jaspreet Singh in Bengaluru and David Shepardson; Editing by Alan Barona)\n\nView Comments",

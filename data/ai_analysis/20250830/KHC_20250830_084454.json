            "content": "(RTTNews) - Kraft Heinz Co. (KHC) is preparing to split itself into two separate businesses, according to a Wall Street Journal report citing people familiar with the matter.\n\nThe plan, which could be finalized and announced as early as next week, would divide the food giant into a grocery-focused company and a sauces-focused company.\n\nThe move follows months of strategic reviews. In July, Kraft Heinz confirmed it was exploring options for its grocery portfolio, including a possible spinoff of several iconic Kraft-branded products. That potential new entity could be valued at up to $20 billion, according to earlier reports. Executives said at the time they were working \"with urgency\" to evaluate alternatives.\n\nBy separating into two units, Kraft Heinz hopes to unlock greater value than its current market capitalization of about $33 billion. The sauces business would retain flagship brands such as Heinz ketchup and Grey Poupon mustard, while the grocery business would house much of the Kraft portfolio. However, the report cautioned that timing and details could still shift.\n\nThe company, created in 2015 through the merger of Kraft Foods and H.J. Heinz orchestrated by Berkshire Hathaway and 3G Capital, has been under pressure to reinvigorate growth. Berkshire Hathaway, led by Warren Buffett, exited Kraft Heinz's board in May.\n\nThe possible breakup comes after Kraft Heinz recently posted better-than-expected quarterly earnings, buoyed by steady U.S. demand for pantry staples and condiments. Shares rose about 2 percent in afternoon trading Friday following the report.\n\nKraft Heinz has not yet commented publicly on the speculation. </p>\n\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.",

            "title": "Ten years after Buffett's big deal, Kraft Heinz eyes a breakup",
            "content": "[Food Giants Kraft And Heinz To Merge]\nScott Olson/Getty Images News\n\nThe Kraft Heinz Company (NASDAQ:KHC [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/KHC]) is reportedly close to finalizing a breakup of one of the country's largest food and beverage company into two entities, according to _The Wall Street Journal_, with an announcement likely to come next week.\n\nSources cited by the newspaper claim the food giant will split off its grocery business – which includes products like Kraft’s Macaroni & Cheese, Velveeta, Jell-O, and Kool-Aid – into an entity that would have a value of around $20B, with the remaining faster-growing segment that includes ketchup and sauces forming a separate and smaller entity. The transaction would essentially undo the 2015 merger between Kraft Foods Group and H.J. Heinz Company which created the third-largest food and beverage company in the U.S.\n\nThe combination was orchestrated in 2015 by Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway and 3G Capital under the terms which gave Kraft shareholders a 49% stake in the combined company and Heinz shareholders a 51% stake. Kraft shareholders received stock in the combined company and a special cash dividend of $16.50 per share, fully funded by an equity contribution by Heinz owners Berkshire Hathaway and 3G Capital. At the time of the merger, the two companies had combined revenue of ~$28B, an amount that would subsequently dwindle to $6.35B.\n\n“I am delighted to play a part in bringing these two winning companies and their iconic brands together. This is my kind of transaction, uniting two world-class organizations and delivering shareholder value. I’m excited by the opportunities for what this new combined organization will achieve,” Warren Buffett said at the time of the merger.\n\nIn an effort to boost profits, the newly-formed Kraft Heinz Company (NASDAQ:KHC [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/KHC]) immediately went to work cutting costs and going on a buying spree which included a failed attempt to acquire Unilever (UL [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/UL]) for $143B in 2017.\n\nUnfortunately, while the company was busy cost-cutting and looking for new toys, it failed to notice the shift in consumer tastes to healthier food options. With sales down amid a pivot away from processed cheese and hot dogs, the company finally conceded that its Kraft and Oscar Mayer brands were worth much less than it was valued at and took a $15B impairment charge. Additionally, then-CEO Bernardo Hees admitted that zero-based budgeting (in which every expense must be justified from a zero-base for each new budgeting period) had failed.\n\n“We were overly optimistic on delivering savings that did not materialize,” Hess said in 2019.\n\nAmid all the hand-wringing, the stock price continued to drop. After peaking in 2017, the company’s shares lost 61% of their value in the 10 years since the merger versus a 237% gain in the S&P 500. This led Berkshire Hathaway to take a second write-down on its 27.4% stake in Kraft Heinz (NASDAQ:KHC [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/KHC]), this time for $3.8B after a $3B write-down in 2019.\n\nPlagued by increased manufacturing costs, Kraft Heinz’s profitability was also dwindling and by 2025 the company fell into the red.\n\nWith few options left, the company is now considering splitting itself into two, a strategy that is unlikely to resuscitate the struggling food and beverage business.\n\n“I do not see how the separation will raise any value,” says Seeking Alpha analyst Alan Galecki. [https://seekingalpha.com/author/alan-galecki] “My concern is that we’ll end up with two sick entities.”\n\n“The proposed spin-off will require strong P&L gains between the two distinct entities, and empirical evidence suggests the KHC spinoff is not likely to produce new value for shareholders,” Seeking Alpha analysts TQP Research [https://seekingalpha.com/author/tqp-research] adds.\n\nAnd Wall Street likely agrees. Since the divestiture talk first started circulating last month, Kraft Heinz (NASDAQ:KHC [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/KHC]) shares have only gained 3% in value.\n\nMORE ON KRAFT HEINZ\n\n \t* Constellation Brands A Better Pick Than Kraft Heinz But Not A Compelling Buy [https://seekingalpha.com/article/4809987-constellation-brands-vs-kraft-heinz-stz-has-stronger-pricing-power-and-balance-sheet]\n \t* Kraft Heinz: Empty Bottle [https://seekingalpha.com/article/4807504-kraft-heinz-empty-bottle]\n \t* The Kraft-Heinz Company: Second-Quarter Report Shows Earnings Have Stagnated [https://seekingalpha.com/article/4807495-the-kraft-heinz-company-second-quarter-report-shows-earnings-have-stagnated]\n \t* Court tosses case accusing food giants of making kids addicted to ultra-processed foods [https://seekingalpha.com/news/4488959-court-tosses-case-accusing-food-giants-of-making-kids-addicted-to-ultra-processed-foods]\n \t* Kraft Heinz falls after Berkshire Hathaway signals a loss of confidence in its decades-old investment [https://seekingalpha.com/news/4477396-kraft-heinz-falls-after-berkshire-hathaway-signals-a-loss-of-confidence-in-its-decades-old-investment]\n\n ",

Reference actual numbers in your reasoning.\n\n3. **Consistency**: Apply the same scoring standards regardless of the stock. A score of 85 should represent the same quality level across all analyses.\n\n4. **Risk Focus**: Pay special attention to red flags that could invalidate the opportunity (poor liquidity, imminent earnings, deteriorating fundamentals).\n\n5. **Strategy Alignment**: Consider how well this opportunity fits options strategies (directional bias, volatility conditions, time decay considerations).\n\n6. **Completeness Check**: If critical data is missing, note it in your analysis but don't penalize the opportunity excessively for data gaps.\n\nAnalyze the KHC opportunity now using this framework and respond with the required JSON format.",

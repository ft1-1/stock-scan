            "content": "What Happened?\n\nShares of electric vehicle pioneer Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) fell 4% in the afternoon session after markets pulled back, with the decline concentrated in the tech space, as investors engaged in profit-taking following a robust week that saw the S&P 500 hit a new record.\n\nAdding to the pressure, new inflation data, specifically the Core PCE, showed an acceleration in July, signaling that rising prices remain a risk despite being in line with expectations. This confluence of factors, including market highs heading into a historically weak September, led to a pullback, with the Nasdaq Composite shedding 1.15%. While the Federal Reserve has hinted at potential rate cuts, the focus on inflation and the jobs market continues to influence investor sentiment.\n\nAlso, a recent study suggested that consumer demand for the company's Full Self-Driving feature is weaker than believed, raising questions about a key potential growth driver.\n\nLastly, new data from the European Automobile Manufacturers Association revealed a 40% year-over-year drop in Tesla's car sales in Europe for July.\n\nThe shares closed the day at $334, down 3.4% from previous close.\n\nThe stock market overreacts to news, and big price drops can present good opportunities to buy high-quality stocks. Is now the time to buy Tesla? Access our full analysis report here, it’s free.\n\nWhat Is The Market Telling Us\n\nTesla’s shares are extremely volatile and have had 46 moves greater than 5% over the last year. In that context, today’s move indicates the market considers this news meaningful but not something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business.\n\nThe previous big move we wrote about was 1 day ago when the stock dropped 1.3% on the news that reports revealed a significant slump in its European sales for July, fueling concerns about increasing competition. The electric vehicle maker's sales in Europe plunged by approximately 40% year-over-year, with various reports showing a drop to around 8,800 vehicles. This decline is particularly concerning as the broader European EV market expanded. Compounding the issue, Chinese rival BYD's sales surged, with its new car registrations outselling Tesla in the region. This consistent loss of ground in major markets is weighing on investor sentiment.\n\nTesla is down 12.1% since the beginning of the year, and at $333.44 per share, it is trading 30.5% below its 52-week high of $479.86 from December 2024. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of Tesla’s shares 5 years ago would now be looking at an investment worth $2,007.\n\nHere at StockStory, we certainly understand the potential of thematic investing. Diverse winners from Microsoft (MSFT) to Alphabet (GOOG), Coca-Cola (KO) to Monster Beverage (MNST) could all have been identified as promising growth stories with a megatrend driving the growth. So, in that spirit, we’ve identified a relatively under-the-radar profitable growth stock benefiting from the rise of AI, available to you FREE via this link.\n\nView Comments",

In that context, today’s move indicates the market considers this news meaningful but not something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business.\n\nThe previous big move we wrote about was 10 days ago when the stock dropped 3.1% on the news that investors took some profits off the table as markets awaited signals on future monetary policy from the Federal Reserve's Jackson Hole symposium later in the week.\n\nThe downturn in the market was largely attributed to a significant sell-off in megacap tech and chipmaker shares. Nvidia, Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), and Broadcom all saw notable drops, dragging down the VanEck Semiconductor ETF. Other major tech-related companies like Tesla, Meta Platforms, and Netflix were also under pressure. A key reason for this trend is that much of the recent market gains have been concentrated in the \"AI trade,\" which includes these large technology and semiconductor companies. So this could also mean that some investors are locking in some gains ahead of more definitive feedback from the Fed.\n\nStory continues\n\niHeartMedia is up 5.4% since the beginning of the year, but at $2.13 per share, it is still trading 18.4% below its 52-week high of $2.61 from December 2024. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of iHeartMedia’s shares 5 years ago would now be looking at an investment worth $231.02.\n\nHere at StockStory, we certainly understand the potential of thematic investing.

The collaboration specifically centers on Domo AI, the company's suite of AI tools that includes features like natural language querying and automated insights. This positive development follows other recent good news for the company. Just a day prior, analysts at TD Cowen upgraded Domo's stock rating to Buy from Hold and significantly raised their price target, citing a belief that the company is \"turning the corner\" on key strategic initiatives that could drive sustained growth.\n\nStory Continues\n\nDomo is up 107% since the beginning of the year, but at $14.69 per share, it is still trading 16.4% below its 52-week high of $17.57 from August 2025.

            "content": "What Happened?\n\nShares of data center products and services company Vertiv (NYSE:VRT) fell 5.2% in the afternoon session after a broader market pullback that particularly impacted the technology and semiconductor sectors. The decline was not isolated to Vertiv, as major indices retreated from recent all-time highs. The S&P 500 dropped by 0.7%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite fell 1.2%. The semiconductor industry faced significant pressure, with the PHLX Semiconductor Index declining by over 3%. This sector-wide downturn also affected major technology companies, including Nvidia and Broadcom, which experienced notable drops. The broad-based selling in the tech space appears to be the primary driver behind the pressure on Vertiv's shares.\n\nThe shares closed the day at $127.59, down 4.9% from previous close.\n\nThe stock market overreacts to news, and big price drops can present good opportunities to buy high-quality stocks.

In that context, today’s move indicates the market considers this news meaningful but not something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business.\n\nThe previous big move we wrote about was 1 day ago when the stock gained 4.1% on the news that the company announced its acquisition of Waylay NV, a Belgium-based specialist in automation and generative AI software. This strategic move is designed to strengthen Vertiv's AI-driven monitoring and optimization technologies for digital infrastructure. The acquisition will enhance the company's ability to help customers increase uptime and optimize energy usage in their data centers. This is particularly relevant as the rise of AI workloads continues to drive higher-density power and cooling demands. By integrating Waylay's hyper-automation and AI platforms, Vertiv is positioning itself to better serve the evolving needs of the critical digital infrastructure market.\n\nVertiv is up 7.5% since the beginning of the year, but at $127.15 per share, it is still trading 17.2% below its 52-week high of $153.49 from January 2025.

            "content": "What Happened?\n\nShares of 3D printing company Stratasys (NASDAQ:SSYS) fell 5.2% in the afternoon session after investors sold off technology stocks amid a wider market retreat.\n\nThe broader market pulled back from recent all-time highs, with the S&P 500 declining 0.8% and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite falling 1.3%. Stratasys, being part of the technology sector, appeared to be caught in the downdraft. No company-specific news was available to explain the decline, indicating that the stock's movement was likely influenced by the negative market sentiment rather than a fundamental change in the company's outlook.\n\nThe shares closed the day at $10.66, down 5% from previous close.\n\nThe stock market overreacts to news, and big price drops can present good opportunities to buy high-quality stocks. Is now the time to buy Stratasys? Access our full analysis report here, it’s free.\n\nWhat Is The Market Telling Us\n\nStratasys’s shares are very volatile and have had 26 moves greater than 5% over the last year. In that context, today’s move indicates the market considers this news meaningful but not something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business.\n\nThe previous big move we wrote about was 16 days ago when the stock dropped 12.5% on the news that the company lowered its full-year financial outlook, citing prolonged macroeconomic challenges.\n\nWhile its second-quarter earnings of $0.03 per share met analyst estimates and revenue of $138.1 million was slightly ahead of forecasts, investors focused on the bleak forecast. Stratasys cut its full-year 2025 revenue guidance to a range of $550 million to $560 million, significantly below the consensus estimate of $572.5 million. The earnings outlook was also slashed, with the company now expecting adjusted earnings per share of $0.13 to $0.16, less than half the $0.32 analysts had projected. CEO Dr. Yoav Zeif attributed the revision to \"prolonged macroeconomic uncertainty and restrained customer capital spending,\" noting that an expected recovery is taking longer than anticipated.\n\nStratasys is up 22.8% since the beginning of the year, but at $10.68 per share, it is still trading 16.9% below its 52-week high of $12.85 from February 2025. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of Stratasys’s shares 5 years ago would now be looking at an investment worth $718.71.\n\nHere at StockStory, we certainly understand the potential of thematic investing.

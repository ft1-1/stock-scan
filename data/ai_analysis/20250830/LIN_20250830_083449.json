            "content": "For Immediate Release\n\nChicago, IL – August 25, 2025 – Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: NVIDIA Corp. NVDA, Cisco Systems, Inc. CSCO and Linde plc LIN.\n\nHere are highlights from Friday’s Analyst Blog:\n\nTop Analyst Reports for NVIDIA, Cisco Systems & Linde\n\nThe Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team. Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including NVIDIA Corp., Cisco Systems, Inc. and Linde plc. These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.\n\nYou can see all of today's research reports here >>>\n\nAhead of Wall Street\n\nThe daily 'Ahead of Wall Street' article is a must-read for all investors who would like to be ready for that day's trading action. The article comes out before the market opens, attempting to make sense of that morning's economic releases and how they will affect that day's market action. You can read this article for free on our home page and can actually sign up there to get an email notification as this article comes out each morning.\n\nYou can read today's AWS here >>> What to Expect from Fed Chair Powell's Jackson Hole Speech\n\nToday's Featured Research Reports\n\nNVIDIA'sshares have outperformed the Zacks Semiconductor - General industry over the year-to-date period (+29.5% vs. +28.6%). The company is benefiting from the strong growth of artificial intelligence (AI) and high-performance, accelerated computing. The growing demand for generative AI and large language models using graphic processing units (GPUs) based on NVIDIA's Hopper and Blackwell architectures is aiding data center revenues.\n\nThe continued ramp-up of Ada RTX GPU workstations in the ProViz end market, following the normalization of channel inventory, is acting as a tailwind. Collaborations with more than 320 automakers and tier-one suppliers are likely to advance its presence in the autonomous vehicle space.\n\nThe Zacks analyst expects NVIDIA's revenues to witness a CAGR of 29% through fiscal 2026-2028. However, a limited supply of Blackwell GPUs could hinder its ability to meet demand. Rising costs associated with the production of more complex AI systems will hurt margins.\n\n(You can read the full research report on NVIDIA here >>>)\n\nStory Continues\n\nShares of Cisco have outperformed the Zacks Computer - Networking industry over the year-to-date period (+16.1% vs. +15.1%). The company's business model has evolved with subscription revenues accounting for more than half of its total revenues. Increase in recurring revenue base bodes well for investors. Splunk acquisition enhances its recurring revenue base.\n\nThe buyout significantly expands Cisco's portfolio of software-based solutions, contributing more than $4 billion in ARR and makes it one of the largest software companies in the world. The launch of AI-powered Hypershield, which combines security and networking, strengthened Cisco's security portfolio.\n\nHowever, it has been suffering from sluggish networking sales, primarily due to lackluster demand from telecommunication and cable services providers, as well as stiff competition. Cisco's prospects are further challenged in the AI-driven networking space due to stiffening competition.\n\n(You can read the full research report on Cisco here >>>)\n\nLinde'sshares have outperformed the Zacks Chemical - Specialty industry over the year-to-date period (+16.2% vs. +8.4%). The company remains a dominant player in the industrial gas sector, delivering strong financial performance with consistent EPS growth, disciplined capital allocation, and industry-leading margins.\n\nLinde's record $10.3 billion backlog ensures long-term revenue stability, while sustainability initiatives position it as a leader in low-carbon energy solutions. Strategic investments in high-return projects and small on-site contracts further reinforce its competitive edge.\n\nHowever, foreign exchange headwinds, softening industrial demand in Europe & China, and regulatory uncertainties pose challenges. Also, slower growth in healthcare impacts diversification efforts. Despite these risks, LIN's strong execution, efficiency improvements, & long-term contracts position it well for sustained profitability & resilience in fluctuating market conditions.\n\n(You can read the full research report on Linde here >>>)\n\nFree: Instant Access to Zacks' Market-Crushing Strategies\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.7% average gain per year.

            "title": "October 3rd Options Now Available For AstraZeneca (AZN)",
            "content": "Investors in AstraZeneca plc (Symbol: AZN) saw new options begin trading today, for the October 3rd expiration.   At Stock Options Channel, our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the AZN options chain for the new October 3rd contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.\n\nThe put contract at the $77.00 strike price has a current bid of 58 cents.  If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $77.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $76.42 (before broker commissions).  To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of AZN, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $80.86/share today.\n\nBecause the $77.00 strike represents an approximate 5% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless.  The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 69%.  Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the contract detail page for this contract.  Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 0.75% return on the cash commitment, or 6.39% annualized — at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost.\n\nBelow is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for AstraZeneca plc, and highlighting in green where the $77.00 strike is located relative to that history:\n\nTurning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $83.00 strike price has a current bid of 45 cents.  If an investor was to purchase shares of AZN stock at the current price level of $80.86/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a \"covered call,\" they are committing to sell the stock at $83.00.  Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 3.20% if the stock gets called away at the October 3rd expiration (before broker commissions).  Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if AZN shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for AstraZeneca plc, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important.   Below is a chart showing AZN's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $83.00 strike highlighted in red:\n\nConsidering the fact that the $83.00 strike represents an approximate 3% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected.  The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 60%.  On our website under the contract detail page for this contract, Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted).   Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 0.56% boost of extra return to the investor, or 4.72% annualized, which we refer to as the YieldBoost.\n\nThe implied volatility in the put contract example is 31%, while the implied volatility in the call contract example is 26%.\n\nMeanwhile, we calculate the actual trailing twelve month volatility (considering the last 250 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $80.86) to be 25%.

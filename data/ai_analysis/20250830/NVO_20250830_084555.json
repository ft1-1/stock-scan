            "content": "This article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nEli Lilly (NYSE:LLY) just pulled the pin on a pricing grenadeand UK pharmacies are ducking for cover. After jacking up Mounjaro's list price by as much as 170%, some pharmacies are refusing to pass the full cost onto patients. Zava, now being acquired by Hims & Hers Health, raised its highest-dose price by just 55% to 309.99, still below Lilly's new 330 benchmark. Pharmacy2U froze its prices for existing patients, even as others like Superdrug ran completely out of stock amid a nationwide shortage. Demand isn't slowing eitherone in five UK adults sought obesity meds last year, and that number's not getting smaller.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 6 Warning Signs with MCO. Is LLY fairly valued? Test your thesis with our free DCF calculator.\n\nBut here's the kicker: Boots is flipping Lilly's price hike into a marketing weapon. The UK giant will charge 335 for Mounjaro's top dose from September 1, but it's dangling a Switch to Wegovy offer that saves patients 129. Novo Nordisk (NYSE:NVO) couldn't have asked for better timing. With customer hotline wait times now stretching up to 60 minutes, the message is loud and clearLilly's move is pushing patients to reconsider their options, and Wegovy is waiting with open arms and lower prices.\n\nUnder the surface, this isn't just a price warit's a pharmacy turf battle. Asda's online doctor, which works with Zava, is slightly undercutting Zava itself. Some players are racing to lock in new customers before the September 1 reset, while others are content riding out the shortage storm. For investors, this chaos signals something deeper: pricing power in the obesity drug market may no longer sit with the drugmakers alone. Pharmacies are becoming the new gatekeepersand Wegovy just found its wedge.\n\nView Comments",

Reference actual numbers in your reasoning.\n\n3. **Consistency**: Apply the same scoring standards regardless of the stock. A score of 85 should represent the same quality level across all analyses.\n\n4. **Risk Focus**: Pay special attention to red flags that could invalidate the opportunity (poor liquidity, imminent earnings, deteriorating fundamentals).\n\n5. **Strategy Alignment**: Consider how well this opportunity fits options strategies (directional bias, volatility conditions, time decay considerations).\n\n6. **Completeness Check**: If critical data is missing, note it in your analysis but don't penalize the opportunity excessively for data gaps.\n\nAnalyze the NVO opportunity now using this framework and respond with the required JSON format.",

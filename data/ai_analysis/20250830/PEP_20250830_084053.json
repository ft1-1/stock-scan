Meanwhile, the Dow experienced a drop of 0.2%, and the technology-dominated Nasdaq saw a decrease of 1.15%.\n\nShares of the food and beverage company have appreciated by 6.57% over the course of the past month, outperforming the Consumer Staples sector's gain of 0.59%, and the S&P 500's gain of 1.91%.\n\nInvestors will be eagerly watching for the performance of PepsiCo in its upcoming earnings disclosure. The company's earnings report is set to be unveiled on October 9, 2025. The company is predicted to post an EPS of $2.27, indicating a 1.73% decline compared to the equivalent quarter last year. Alongside, our most recent consensus estimate is anticipating revenue of $23.79 billion, indicating a 2% upward movement from the same quarter last year.\n\nPEP's full-year Zacks Consensus Estimates are calling for earnings of $8.01 per share and revenue of $93.06 billion. These results would represent year-over-year changes of -1.84% and +1.31%, respectively.\n\nAny recent changes to analyst estimates for PepsiCo should also be noted by investors. These latest adjustments often mirror the shifting dynamics of short-term business patterns. Therefore, positive revisions in estimates convey analysts' confidence in the business performance and profit potential.\n\nOur research demonstrates that these adjustments in estimates directly associate with imminent stock price performance. To take advantage of this, we've established the Zacks Rank, an exclusive model that considers these estimated changes and delivers an operational rating system.\n\nThe Zacks Rank system, spanning from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), boasts an impressive track record of outperformance, audited externally, with #1 ranked stocks yielding an average annual return of +25% since 1988.

This expresses a premium compared to the average Forward P/E of 18.06 of its industry.\n\nIt's also important to note that PEP currently trades at a PEG ratio of 3.92. The PEG ratio is similar to the widely-used P/E ratio, but this metric also takes the company's expected earnings growth rate into account. The Beverages - Soft drinks industry had an average PEG ratio of 2.03 as trading concluded yesterday.\n\nStory Continues\n\nThe Beverages - Soft drinks industry is part of the Consumer Staples sector. With its current Zacks Industry Rank of 172, this industry ranks in the bottom 31% of all industries, numbering over 250.\n\nThe Zacks Industry Rank gauges the strength of our industry groups by measuring the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks within the groups.

The $25 billion U.S. energy drink market is projected to grow at 7.2% annually through 2030, based on Grand View Research data.\n\nThe deal positions the companies to better compete against Red Bull and Monster Beverage (MNST), the latter of which is 19% owned by Coca-Cola.\n\nCelsius stock climbed nearly 4% midday Friday and has more than doubled in 2025.\n\nView Comments",

The \"core\" Personal Consumption Expenditures index, closely studied by the central bank, rose 0.3% on a monthly basis and 2.9% on an annual basis, above the Fed's 2% inflation target. Both numbers matched economist expectations, though the annual pace marked the biggest rise since February.\n\nMeanwhile, US consumer sentiment declined to a three-month low as consumers in a University of Michigan survey suggested they expect inflation to surge over the next year.\n\nFriday's data comes after signs of a resilient economy helped lift the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average to new all-time highs on Thursday.\n\nBets that the Fed will ease rates at its September meeting were still riding high Friday, and traders were pricing in an 87% chance of a quarter-point cut following the PCE reading.\n\nThe inflation data caps a whirlwind week for markets gripped by Nvidia earnings and President Trump's effort to oust Fed governor Lisa Cook, which took a new turn. On Friday, a judge is expected to rule on Cook's bid for a temporary restraining order.\n\nDespite the pullback in stocks on Friday, the major indexes were set for their longest streak of consecutive monthly gains in more than a year.\n\nThe tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite was on track to see a 2% bump in August, marking its fifth straight monthly rise, the longest winning streak in nearly a year and a half. For their part, the S&P 500 and the Dow were set for their fourth consecutive month of gains, on track to add 1.6% and 2%, respectively — the longest since September 2024.\n\nAnd the Russell 2000 (^RUT), which includes small market capitalization companies, eyed a 6% jump for August, on course for its fourth monthly uptick, the longest streak in over four years.\n\nStory Continues\n\nMarkets are closed on Monday for the Labor Day holiday.LIVE25 updates\n\n8 mins ago\n\nGrace O'Donnell\n\nStocks close lower to end month on a downbeat note\n\nNvidia (NVDA) and Big Tech led the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) and other indexes lower on Friday in a subdued finish to the month.

Add to this the fact that September and October are historically the two most volatile months with VIX often spiking toward 20, according to Bloomberg data.\n\nInvestors also face a loaded September calendar. The US August jobs report is due to be released next Friday, followed by the latest inflation data the following week.\n\nAll eyes will also be on the September FOMC meeting next month, at which investors anticipate policy members will likely cut rates by 25 basis points. 46 mins ago\n\nGrace O'Donnell\n\nIs the stock market closed on Labor Day?\n\nThe stock and bond markets will be closed on Monday, Sept. 1, for the Labor Day holiday.

China's BYD (BYDDY), Volkswagen, and BMW all saw gains.\n\nTo try to goose sales in the region, Tesla unveiled a new high-end variant of the Model Y crossover SUV on Friday, which will only be available in Europe for the time being.\n\nMeanwhile, Tesla CEO Elon Musk sought to have an SEC case related to his disclosure of his Twitter stake in 2022 dismissed. Musk said the SEC's enforcement \"reveals an agency targeting an individual for his protected criticism of government overreach.\"\n\nIn a separate filing, Musk's legal team also asked for the venue of the case to be moved to the Western District of Texas instead of Washington, D.C.\n\nRead more about the new Model Y Performance EV here.

Reference actual numbers in your reasoning.\n\n3. **Consistency**: Apply the same scoring standards regardless of the stock. A score of 85 should represent the same quality level across all analyses.\n\n4. **Risk Focus**: Pay special attention to red flags that could invalidate the opportunity (poor liquidity, imminent earnings, deteriorating fundamentals).\n\n5. **Strategy Alignment**: Consider how well this opportunity fits options strategies (directional bias, volatility conditions, time decay considerations).\n\n6. **Completeness Check**: If critical data is missing, note it in your analysis but don't penalize the opportunity excessively for data gaps.\n\nAnalyze the PEP opportunity now using this framework and respond with the required JSON format.",

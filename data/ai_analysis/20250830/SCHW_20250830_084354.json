Each week we monitor the week-over-week change in shares outstanding data, to keep a lookout for those ETFs experiencing notable inflows (many new units created) or outflows (many old units destroyed).

            "content": "Investors heavily exposed to artificial intelligence (AI) may want to think about where else to put their money as markets shift. Drew Pettit, Citi US equity strategist, explains how fintech and wearable tech could balance out investor portfolios.\n\nTo watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Market Domination.\n\nVideo Transcript\n\n00:10 Speaker A\n\nNvidia reporting second quarter earnings on Wednesday. The company is at the forefront of AI which is dominating market performance, but a recent report from city highlights sectors outside of the AI trade where investors can look for opportunity, including Fintech and wearable technology. We're navigating how to play outside of the AI sector with the Yahoo Finance playbook. Joining me now is Drew Petit, US Equity strategist at City. Drew, it's great to see you. So, when you were searching for these non-AI opportunities, Drew, what were you searching for? Can you can you walk me through your screen?\n\n00:54 Drew Petit\n\nYeah, so first and foremost, I was looking for something where investors can complete their portfolios. We get it. AI is and has been an amazing theme to be invested in. It's still one of our favorite themes. We don't think you can ignore it. But that's really just the growth side of your portfolio. You need some value exposure, you need some stuff to basically round out the portfolio. So, first and foremost, I was looking for more value style stocks and themes that can complement AI and build out a well-rounded portfolio.\n\n01:35 Speaker A\n\nAnd so what came through that screen? It sounds like Fintech and wearable tech, Drew?\n\n01:42 Drew Petit\n\nYeah, so these stuck out because, look, even if you are a value stock or a value theme, you're not cheap. and I always air quote cheap. But here, you need good earnings follow through or an earnings growth inflection. You need solid quality metrics because again, you're not cheap. So when Fintech and wearable tech, so that's a lot of kind of healthcare devices, they stood out because they had really strong fundamentals and they weren't priced to perfection.\n\n02:14 Speaker A\n\nSo if you're already overweight AI, how as an investor should you think about uh these kind of non-AI themes? How should they fit into your portfolio, Drew?\n\n02:26 Drew Petit\n\nYeah, it's funny. So, thinking about the balance, I would say AI, even when you think about the S&P 500, it's probably about 50% of your portfolio, at least your US equity portfolio. So these other themes attach around the outside of it or adjacent to it. So you should be looking at a pretty heavy weight. Let's call it maybe half half your weight of your US equity exposure in AI. The other half can go into these themes, they can go into broader areas like financials, uh utilities as well. I think it's a really nice way to kind of compliment and blend everything together.\n\n03:02 Speaker A\n\nWe talked about the valuation for what what came through the screen, Drew. How how did earnings growth look?\n\n03:08 Drew Petit\n\nYeah, so it's funny, for value, let let's just start high level, value, you're starting to starting to see earnings growth inflect. For the next year, you should see earnings growth of almost 10%, but we don't have a lot of confidence in that actually being true because we've seen a lot of earnings downgrades for value as a whole. For Fintech and wearable tech, we expect these to grow between kind of high single digits in the low teens, but the difference here is the revisions have actually been really stable. You haven't seen a lot of cuts to 2026 numbers. So you should see premium growth to the other half or the value side of the index, but again, not fully priced in.\n\n03:51 Speaker A\n\nAny specific names you'd highlight for us, Drew?\n\n03:55 Drew Petit\n\nYeah, it's funny. On on Fintech, you know, we go back to some old school names that are kind of market leaders in in integrating. So Capital One Financial, who just bought, you know, Discover cards and so on, Black Rock, Charles Schwab, and then even someone who's tied to the mortgage market, Equifax, for example. I think those are really interesting Fintech names, maybe not as techy as interesting as people think, but offer really good value and our analysts have a pretty strong conviction. On the wearable tech side, Boston Scientific and Medtronic, two different stories. Medtronic more of a turnaround, Boston Scientific, basically the best in the space if you ask our analysts.\n\n04:35 Speaker A\n\nAnd I know this is, you know, this is a non-AI discussion, Drew, but in this report, did I see that did you add Nvidia to your AI at a at a reasonable price basket?\n\n04:49 Drew Petit\n\nIt was in there before and this is kind of the interesting story when you think about Nvidia tonight. It's not really about where the stock is priced or what's going on in the quarter. It's about the out years. and this is a stock, even though it keeps moving higher, the out-year estimates for 2026, 2027 keep moving higher. So to us, we thought it was a really good time to add this to our portfolio because it it hasn't been there this year.\n\n05:14 Speaker A\n\nYou know, Drew, finally, I was talking to a strategist on the show today, a long time market watcher like yourself, and I asked him, what is more important to the market now? I said, Drew, is it is it the Fed, or is it the great AI trade and trend? He said the latter, but what do you think, Drew?\n\n05:32 Drew Petit\n\nIt's funny. If I had to pick between the two, I might agree and say the latter, but to us it's the fundamentals and what AI and tech development and innovation means for company fundamentals. It's not just the tech companies that can benefit from this. We see AI permeating a lot of different industries and it should show up in better margins, better productivity, better sales and earnings per employee. All of those enhancements really make the S&P 500 a structural winner. So, yeah, between the two, I I would pick AI and tech innovation as well.\n\n06:10 Speaker A\n\nDrew, always great to see you and to have you on the show. Thank you.\n\n06:14 Drew Petit\n\nYeah, thanks for having me.

This disinflation has occurred without severely impacting economic growth, suggesting the success of a soft landing. The stock market thrived in 2024, spurred by recent rate cuts (0.5% in September and 0.25% in November), and a notable surge followed Donald Trump’s presidential election win in November, propelling indices to historic highs. Nonetheless, the outlook for 2025 remains clouded by potential trade policy changes and corporate tax discussions, which could impact business confidence and growth. The path forward holds both optimism and caution as new policies take shape.\n\nWant to invest in winners with rock-solid fundamentals?

            "content": "Have we seen the normal August trading lull that we usually see during the Dog Days of Summer?\n\nOur Chief Equity Strategist and Economist, John Blank, has been keeping his eye on that. He’s here now with the answer.\n\n1. So, until last Friday, have we seen lower daily trading volumes causing higher volatility that would indicate many traders are on summer vacation and, overall, there has been an August lull?\n\n2. Back on August fourth, published data showed the Dow 30 index was the only benchmark that had yet to hit a new peak after April's tariff panic. But that changed last Friday when Fed Chairman Powell signaled the Fed could begin easing monetary policy next month, in his annual Jackson Jole speech. That sent the Dow to an all time high. In fact, there was a pretty broad based stock rally as well. I guess he gave the market exactly what it wanted to hear?\n\n3. September is typically not a good month for stocks. Might this late summer rally extend into next month aided by a rate cut?\n\n4. Is there still uncertainty affecting the market?\n\n5. Is there any reason for stock market bulls to be cautious going into fall?\n\n6. Tech stocks sold off a bit recently. Are investors rotating out of the riskier stocks into previously lagging sectors because they’re worried about the staying power of AI?\n\n7. Will it be difficult to pick winners out of the AI universe going forward?\n\n8. But against this backdrop, does a stronger than expected Q2 earnings season and a bullish outlook for earnings into next year, suggest to you that the S&P500 has more room to run higher, at least, for the rest of this year?\n\n9. Two major U.S. financial services stocks and one major French industrial have been on your radar lately. Charles Schwab SCHW, Citigroup C and Schneider Electric SBGSY.\n\nOur Chief Equity Strategist and Economist, John Blank, on stocks and the August trading lull.

Reference actual numbers in your reasoning.\n\n3. **Consistency**: Apply the same scoring standards regardless of the stock. A score of 85 should represent the same quality level across all analyses.\n\n4. **Risk Focus**: Pay special attention to red flags that could invalidate the opportunity (poor liquidity, imminent earnings, deteriorating fundamentals).\n\n5. **Strategy Alignment**: Consider how well this opportunity fits options strategies (directional bias, volatility conditions, time decay considerations).\n\n6. **Completeness Check**: If critical data is missing, note it in your analysis but don't penalize the opportunity excessively for data gaps.\n\nAnalyze the SCHW opportunity now using this framework and respond with the required JSON format.",

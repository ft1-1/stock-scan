            "content": "TSMC (TSM) closed the most recent trading day at $231.00, moving -3.05% from the previous trading session. The stock trailed the S&P 500, which registered a daily loss of 0.64%. Elsewhere, the Dow lost 0.2%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq lost 1.15%.\n\nComing into today, shares of the chip company had lost 1.39% in the past month. In that same time, the Computer and Technology sector gained 2.91%, while the S&P 500 gained 1.91%.\n\nThe upcoming earnings release of TSMC will be of great interest to investors. On that day, TSMC is projected to report earnings of $2.56 per share, which would represent year-over-year growth of 31.96%. Meanwhile, our latest consensus estimate is calling for revenue of $32.31 billion, up 37.48% from the prior-year quarter.\n\nIn terms of the entire fiscal year, the Zacks Consensus Estimates predict earnings of $9.83 per share and a revenue of $122.4 billion, indicating changes of +39.63% and +35.88%, respectively, from the former year.\n\nIt's also important for investors to be aware of any recent modifications to analyst estimates for TSMC. These latest adjustments often mirror the shifting dynamics of short-term business patterns. With this in mind, we can consider positive estimate revisions a sign of optimism about the business outlook.\n\nResearch indicates that these estimate revisions are directly correlated with near-term share price momentum. To take advantage of this, we've established the Zacks Rank, an exclusive model that considers these estimated changes and delivers an operational rating system.\n\nRanging from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), the Zacks Rank system has a proven, outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks returning an average of +25% annually since 1988. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has witnessed a 0.43% decrease. TSMC presently features a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold).\n\nFrom a valuation perspective, TSMC is currently exchanging hands at a Forward P/E ratio of 24.25. This denotes no noticeable deviation relative to the industry average Forward P/E of 24.25.\n\nIt is also worth noting that TSM currently has a PEG ratio of 1.13. This popular metric is similar to the widely-known P/E ratio, with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company's expected earnings growth rate. By the end of yesterday's trading, the Semiconductor - Circuit Foundry industry had an average PEG ratio of 1.13.\n\nThe Semiconductor - Circuit Foundry industry is part of the Computer and Technology sector. With its current Zacks Industry Rank of 99, this industry ranks in the top 41% of all industries, numbering over 250.\n\nStory Continues\n\nThe Zacks Industry Rank gauges the strength of our individual industry groups by measuring the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks within the groups. Our research shows that the top 50% rated industries outperform the bottom half by a factor of 2 to 1.\n\nTo follow TSM in the coming trading sessions, be sure to utilize Zacks.com.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

            "content": "This article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nTrump has already dropped a policy bombshell that could reshape the global chip supply chain but Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) may have just dodged the worst of it. The president announced a potential 100% tariff on semiconductor imports, while promising exemptions for companies that build in America. Standing beside Tim Cook in the Oval Office, Trump praised Apple's new $100 billion U.S. manufacturing commitment, which now brings its total domestic pledge to $600 billion. Cook's plan includes a new glass factory in Kentucky and deeper partnerships with Corning (NYSE:GLW), Texas Instruments (NASDAQ:TXN), and Applied Materials (NASDAQ:AMAT). For Apple, that investment may be the difference between steep penalties and a free pass.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Signs with MRVL. Is AAPL fairly valued? Test your thesis with our free DCF calculator.\n\nInvestors were rattled by the headline number but quickly found relief. TSMC (NYSE:TSM) and Samsung (SSNLF), both major Apple suppliers, were also granted exemptions after confirming U.S. investment plans. Markets responded accordingly: U.S. futures rose, and Apple shares found support. According to Global X's Billy Leung, Apple's move gave the market a shot of confidence, especially as concerns about a broader supply chain hit began to fade. But the fine print matters. Trump's administration is separately preparing tariffs on all finished goods containing chips which could include everything from smartphones to refrigerators. And while Apple's chipmaking partners like Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) have voiced support for U.S.-based sourcing, there's simply not enough domestic capacity to meet demand in the near term.\n\nGeopolitics is complicating the equation. India Apple's key iPhone assembly hub is now staring down a 50% tariff, to be phased in over the coming weeks. Vietnam, where Apple assembles iPads, Apple Watches, and MacBooks, is now subject to a 20% U.S. import tarifftaxes that Apple pays directly or passes on to American consumers. While Cook acknowledged that final iPhone assembly will remain overseas for a while, he emphasized Apple's growing U.S. footprint and sourcing strategy. Trump, for now, seems satisfied. Apple's coming back to America, he said. Whether that's enough to keep future tariffs at bay and how competitors respond is what investors will be watching next.\n\nView Comments",

            "title": "What's Going On With Broadcom Stock Friday?",
            "content": "Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) shares slipped Friday, weighed down by weakness in rival Marvell Technology (NASDAQ:MRVL) after the latter posted better-than-expected quarterly earnings but tempered sentiment with cautious guidance and a wave of analyst price forecast cuts.\n\nBoth companies are key players in the fast-expanding market for custom AI silicon and networking infrastructure used by cloud providers and hyperscale data centers.\n\nMarvell’s stock slid despite reporting adjusted earnings of 67 cents per share, slightly ahead of the 0.66 cents consensus estimate. Revenue came in at $2.006 billion, a fraction below the $2.009 billion forecast, with adjusted gross margin steady at 59.4%.\n\nAlso Read: Broadcom Stock Jumps After Nvidia Forecasts Massive AI Demand\n\nThe company credited ongoing demand for its AI-focused custom silicon and electro-optics products for the resilience in profitability.\n\nThe outlook, however, underwhelmed investors. For the fiscal third quarter, Marvell projected revenue between $1.96 billion and $2.16 billion, bracketing the Street’s $2.11 billion forecast. It guided adjusted earnings per share in the range of 69 cents to 79 cents, compared with the consensus of 72 cents.\n\nAnalysts trimmed forecasts, citing execution risks and uneven demand.\n\nRosenblatt Securities called Marvell’s results mixed, citing weaker data center ASIC shipments that weighed on revenue despite an earnings beat. The firm cut its fiscal 2027 revenue outlook after the sale of Marvell’s Automotive Ethernet unit and softer data center trends but kept a Buy rating, pointing to a strong pipeline of 18 ASICs and 50-plus design wins. Its 12-month price forecast was lowered to $95 from $124.\n\nJP Morgan said July-quarter results were in line, with stronger consumer sales offsetting softer data center and carrier demand. Guidance for October was also broadly in line, excluding the divestiture. The bank expects flat data center revenue, 30% growth in carrier and enterprise networking, and a reacceleration of ASIC shipments in 2026. It reiterated Overweight but cut its price forecast to $120 from $130, highlighting Amazon’s (NASDAQ:AMZN) Trainium and Microsoft’s (NASDAQ:MSFT) Maia ASIC ramps.\n\nGoldman Sachs viewed results as in line, with margins ahead but limited near-term upside in custom silicon. Analyst James Schneider kept a Neutral rating, trimming his price forecast to $72 from $75 and EPS estimates by about 5% to $3.00. He flagged ongoing content loss at Amazon but noted optical demand remains strong, with custom silicon expected to rebound later this year.\n\nStory Continues\n\nThis cautious sentiment surrounding Marvell’s forecast unfolded amid broader concerns within the semiconductor industry. On Friday, reports emerged that Alibaba Group (NYSE:BABA) is currently testing a domestically manufactured AI inference chip.\n\nThis initiative aligns with China’s broader strategy to lessen its dependency on U.S. suppliers, such as Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA). The chip, designed for a broad range of inference tasks, was reportedly built in China rather than being outsourced to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE:TSM), further underscoring Beijing’s push for technological self-sufficiency.\n\nPrice Action: AVGO stock is trading lower by 4.54% to $294.63 at last check Friday.\n\nRead Next:\n\nNutanix Poised To Capture Market Share With Expanding Cloud Platform And VMware Disruption: Analyst\n\nImage via Shutterstock\n\nUp Next: Transform your trading with Benzinga Edge's one-of-a-kind market trade ideas and tools.

Reference actual numbers in your reasoning.\n\n3. **Consistency**: Apply the same scoring standards regardless of the stock. A score of 85 should represent the same quality level across all analyses.\n\n4. **Risk Focus**: Pay special attention to red flags that could invalidate the opportunity (poor liquidity, imminent earnings, deteriorating fundamentals).\n\n5. **Strategy Alignment**: Consider how well this opportunity fits options strategies (directional bias, volatility conditions, time decay considerations).\n\n6. **Completeness Check**: If critical data is missing, note it in your analysis but don't penalize the opportunity excessively for data gaps.\n\nAnalyze the TSM opportunity now using this framework and respond with the required JSON format.",

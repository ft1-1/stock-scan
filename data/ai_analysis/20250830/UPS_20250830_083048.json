            "title": "Revenue Woes Continue to Plague UPS: Is a Turnaround on the Horizon?",
            "content": "United Parcel Service UPS is currently suffering from revenue weakness as geopolitical uncertainty and high inflation continue to hurt consumer sentiment and growth expectations. The weak demand scenario due to the economic slowdown has also led to a decline in the volume of packages shipped.\n\nAverage daily volumes on a consolidated basis declined 3.8% year over year in the first half of 2025. Driven by sluggish volumes, total revenues at UPS fell 1.7% year over year in the first six months of 2025. Volumes are expected to remain subdued at least in the near term. UPS’ decision, taken earlier this year, to trim the business with Amazon AMZN is likely to keep near-term volumes subdued. UPS’ management had reached an agreement in principle with Amazon to lower the latter’s volume by more than 50% by June 2026. According to Carol Tome, UPS’ chief executive officer, Amazon was not its most profitable customer. We expect the consolidated average daily volumes to decline by 9.4% in 2025 from 2024’s actuals.\n\nThe trade-related economic uncertainty adds to UPS’ woes. While releasing its second-quarter 2025 results, UPS did not unveil any revenue or operating profit guidance for 2025, citing macroeconomic uncertainty. Volatility is likely to persist in the U.S. stock market going forward due to uncertainty over the timing of the next interest rate cut, new tariffs and ongoing geopolitical tensions. This is likely to keep UPS’ top line under pressure for at least the rest of the year despite its cost-cutting efforts.\n\nUPS’ rival FedEx FDX is also cutting costs to combat the weak demand scenario. FedEx reportedly will lay off more than 480 employees as it reshuffles operations through the Network 2.0 initiative. In the second quarter of 2023, FedEx announced DRIVE, a comprehensive program to improve its long-term profitability. The DRIVE program resulted in $1.8 billion in permanent savings in fiscal 2024. The program resulted in further $2.2 billion cost savings in fiscal 2025. These cost reduction initiatives include reducing flight frequencies, parking aircraft and cutting staff.\n\nUPS’ Price Performance, Valuation & Estimates\n\nShares of UPS have declined in excess of 30% so far this year, underperforming its industry.\n\nYTD Price ComparisonZacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nFrom a valuation standpoint, UPS trades at a 12-month forward price-to-earnings ratio of 12.28X, nearly in line with industrial levels.Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for UPS’ third-quarter 2025, fourth-quarter 2025, full-year 2025 and full-year 2026 earnings has been revised downward over the past 60 days.\n\nStory Continues\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nUPS’ Zacks Rank\n\nUPS currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).\n\nYou can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

            "content": "This article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nAnalysts and industry experts warn that the U.S. government's decision to end the long-standing de minimis exemption could significantly reshape global e-commerce flows. Starting Friday, parcels valued under $800, which for years entered the U.S. duty-free, will now be subject to tariffs under President Donald Trump's trade measures. In fiscal 2024, nearly 1.4 billion low-value parcels averaging 3.7 million a day entered the U.S. without duties, fueling rapid growth for platforms like Amazon.com Inc. and Shein. With the exemption gone, analysts suggest the cost structure for cross-border online shopping could change materially, especially as consumers face new import fees and delivery delays.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 5 Warning Sign with UNH. Is FDX fairly valued? Test your thesis with our free DCF calculator.\n\nLogistics specialists highlight two immediate scenarios under the revised policy. Parcels will either be taxed according to Trump-era country-of-origin tariff rates or assessed a temporary flat fee of $80 to $200 per item for the next six months. However, with limited regulatory clarity, global postal services and sellers are pausing U.S. shipments until they receive further instructions, creating friction in an already complex supply chain. Small businesses are among the most exposed, faced with a choice between suspending U.S. orders or shifting to higher-cost express carriers like UPS (NYSE:UPS) and FedEx Corp (NYSE:FDX). According to logistics consultant Derek Lossing, rerouted volumes from halted postal channels could increase pressure on private carriers and may introduce pricing volatility in the near term.\n\nConsumer impact is already visible. Louisiana gamer Chris Pawlukiewicz faced a $934 tariff bill on computer parts ordered from Germany, ultimately paying around 75% of the original purchase price after brokers' fees. Similarly, Alabama college student Josh Gachera received a $190 FedEx invoice weeks after buying $1,029 Italian-made boots from Canada. Trade specialists suggest this is a preview of what's ahead for millions of cross-border shoppers and small retailers navigating the shift. While large e-commerce platforms with stronger infrastructure may absorb some of the cost pressures, analysts note that smaller sellers could struggle to remain competitive if tariffs persist. The next six months could be a critical transition period for retailers, carriers, and consumers alike as global trade patterns adjust to a new regulatory framework.\n\nView Comments",

            "title": "Why Is UPS (UPS) Up 0.8% Since Last Earnings Report?",
            "content": "It has been about a month since the last earnings report for United Parcel Service (UPS). Shares have added about 0.8% in that time frame, underperforming the S&P 500.\n\nBut investors have to be wondering, will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is UPS due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.\n\nEarnings Miss at UPS in Q2\n\nQuarterly earnings per share of $1.55 missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny and declined 13.4% year over year. Revenues of $21.2 billion surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $20.8 billion but decreased 2.7% year over year.\n\nOther Aspects of Q2 Earnings Report\n\nU.S. Domestic Package revenues of $14.08 billion declined 0.8% year over year, owing to the expected decline in volume, partially offset by increases in air cargo and revenue per piece. The actual segmental sales figure was higher than our estimation of $13.86 billion. Segmental operating profit (adjusted) fell 1.4% year over year to $982 million. The adjusted operating margin for the segment was 7%.\r\n\r\nRevenues in the International Package division totaled $4.48 billion, which increased 2.6% year over year, owing to a 3.9% increase in average daily volume. The actual segmental sales figure was higher than our estimation of $4.28 billion. Segmental operating profit (adjusted) totaled $682 million, down 17.2% year over year. The adjusted operating margin for the segment was 15.2%.\r\n\r\nSupply Chain Solutions’ revenues of $2.65 billion decreased 18.3% year over year, owing to the impact of the third quarter of 2024 divestiture of Coyote. The actual segmental sales figure was below our estimation of $2.82 billion. Operating profit (on an adjusted basis) fell 13.1% year over year to $212 million. The adjusted operating margin for the segment was 8%.\r\n\r\nThe overall adjusted operating margin was 8.8%.\n\nOutlook\n\nCiting the current macroeconomic uncertainty, UPS did not unveil any revenue or operating profit guidance for 2025. UPS is affirming 2025 guidance for the following metrics.\r\n\r\nCapital expenditures are estimated to be around $3.5 billion, with dividend payments expected to be around $5.5 billion (subject to board approval) and share repurchases of around $1.0 billion (which have been completed).\r\n\r\nThe effective tax rate is expected to be around 23.5%.\r\n\r\nUPS expects to witness $3.5 billion in reductions in expenses due to its network reconfiguration and Efficiency Reimagined initiatives.\n\nStory Continues\n\nHow Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?\n\nIn the past month, investors have witnessed a downward trend in fresh estimates.\n\nThe consensus estimate has shifted -15.64% due to these changes.\n\nVGM Scores\n\nCurrently, UPS has a subpar Growth Score of D, a score with the same score on the momentum front. However, the stock has a score of B on the value side, putting it in the top 40% for value investors.\n\nOverall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of C. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.\n\nOutlook\n\nEstimates have been broadly trending downward for the stock, and the magnitude of these revisions indicates a downward shift. It's no surprise UPS has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). We expect a below average return from the stock in the next few months.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

            "content": "Key drivers for ESS adoption include the need for IT system resilience and operational cost management\n\nBOULDER, Colo., Aug. 28, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- A new report from Guidehouse Research analyzes the global market for energy storage systems (ESS) in data centers.(PRNewsfoto/Guidehouse Insights)\n\nThe market is defined by both established use cases and emerging opportunities. Short-duration uninterruptible power supplies (UPS) are nearly ubiquitous in data centers today, while interest in longer-duration, large-scale ESS is growing—particularly among hyperscalers seeking to meet energy goals. According to a new report from Guidehouse Research, annual UPS capacity additions in data centers are expected to grow globally from 7.7 GW in 2025 to 29.5 GW in 2034, representing a CAGR of 16.1%.\n\n\"As global data center development accelerates, the UPS market is expected to grow in tandem, while large-scale ESS adoption will depend on overcoming physical, financial, and policy-related constraints,\" said Grant Samms, research analyst with Guidehouse Research. \"However, high costs, regulatory uncertainty, scalability limitations, and aging grid infrastructure pose significant challenges, especially for long-duration energy storage (LDES).\"\n\nSeveral key factors are driving ESS adoption in data centers, led by the need to ensure IT system resilience and reliability, which underpins the widespread use of UPS. Resilience goals are also fueling interest in large-scale ESS as operators work to reduce emissions and integrate renewable energy, while cost management opportunities such as peak shaving, load shifting, and participation in grid services markets add further incentive. However, significant barriers remain—particularly for LDES—including high capital costs, policy uncertainty such as trade actions and incentive volatility, and integration challenges with aging grid infrastructure. Safety concerns around Li-ion batteries, though beginning to ease, still contribute to hesitancy among some operators, according to the report.\n\nThe report, Energy Storage Systems for Data Centers, analyzes the market for energy storage systems in data centers over the next decade. Analyses are segmented by world region, storage technology, and data center tier, and include both capacity and revenue projections.

Reference actual numbers in your reasoning.\n\n3. **Consistency**: Apply the same scoring standards regardless of the stock. A score of 85 should represent the same quality level across all analyses.\n\n4. **Risk Focus**: Pay special attention to red flags that could invalidate the opportunity (poor liquidity, imminent earnings, deteriorating fundamentals).\n\n5. **Strategy Alignment**: Consider how well this opportunity fits options strategies (directional bias, volatility conditions, time decay considerations).\n\n6. **Completeness Check**: If critical data is missing, note it in your analysis but don't penalize the opportunity excessively for data gaps.\n\nAnalyze the UPS opportunity now using this framework and respond with the required JSON format.",

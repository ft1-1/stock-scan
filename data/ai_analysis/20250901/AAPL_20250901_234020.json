            "content": "Benzinga and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue on some items through the links below.\n\nAnthony Scaramucci, the founder of SkyBridge Capital, has forecasted a potential 40% drop in Bitcoin’s value before it hits the $500,000 milestone.\n\nScaramucci, a seasoned Wall Street veteran, sees volatility as an inherent part of the cryptocurrency market. He underscored the significance of long-term investment and urged investors to be ready for market swings.\n\nDespite his warning of a potential correction, Scaramucci remains optimistic about Bitcoin’s future, predicting its value to reach half a million dollars within the next five to six years.\n\nTrending: Would you have invested in eBay or Uber early? The same backers are betting on this vacation home platform at just $2.90 per share.\n\n\"I predict that Bitcoin will probably get to $500,000 over the next five or six years. But could we have a 40% correction between now and then? Certainly. So you know, you got to be ready,\" Scaramucci said.\n\nSpeaking with Coinage, he pointed out the discrepancy between market perception and reality, implying that Bitcoin’s adoption is still in its infancy.\n\nScaramucci encouraged investors to hold onto their assets, citing his own experience of prematurely selling shares in companies like Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA). He emphasized that underestimating the potential of Bitcoin is the gravest mistake an investor can make.\n\n\"If you have a great asset and I believe Bitcoin is a great asset, hold the asset. I sold Apple, I sold Amazon, I sold Microsoft, I sold Nvidia when it was a gaming company, and I didn't really understand it. The mistakes I've made in my career is I've sold great assets too early. Learn from my 37 years on Wall Street, learn from my mistakes,\" he said during the conversation.\n\nSee Also: Wealth Managers Charge 1% or More in AUM Fees — Range's AI Platform Does It All for a Flat Fee (and Could Save You $10,000+ Annually). Book Your Demo Today.\n\nWhile recognizing the current bullish trend of the crypto market, Scaramucci cautioned investors to prepare for a possible crypto crash, reminding them that good times don’t last forever.\n\nScaramucci’s predictions underscore the volatile nature of the cryptocurrency market. His advice to investors to hold onto their assets and not underestimate Bitcoin’s potential highlights the long-term view many are taking towards this digital asset.\n\nStory Continues\n\nHis warning of a possible crypto crash serves as a reminder to investors that while the market may be bullish now, it is subject to rapid and significant changes.\n\nTrending Now:\n\n‘Scrolling To UBI' — Deloitte's #1 fastest-growing software company allows users to earn money on their phones. You can invest today for just $0.30/share. If there was a new fund backed by Jeff Bezos offering a 7-9% target yield with monthly dividends would you invest in it?\n\nBuilding Wealth Across More Than Just the Market\n\nBuilding a resilient portfolio means thinking beyond a single asset or market trend. Economic cycles shift, sectors rise and fall, and no one investment performs well in every environment. That's why many investors look to diversify with platforms that provide access to real estate, fixed-income opportunities, professional financial guidance, precious metals, and even self-directed retirement accounts. By spreading exposure across multiple asset classes, it becomes easier to manage risk, capture steady returns, and create long-term wealth that isn't tied to the fortunes of just one company or industry.\n\nArrived Homes\n\nBacked by Jeff Bezos, Arrived Homes makes real estate investing accessible with a low barrier to entry. Investors can buy fractional shares of single-family rentals and vacation homes starting with as little as $100. This allows everyday investors to diversify into real estate, collect rental income, and build long-term wealth without needing to manage properties directly.\n\nWorthy Bonds\n\nFor those seeking fixed-income style returns without Wall Street complexity, Worthy Bonds offers SEC-qualified, interest-bearing bonds starting at just $10. Investors earn a fixed 7% annual return, with funds deployed to small U.S. businesses. The bonds are fully liquid, meaning you can cash out anytime, making them attractive for conservative investors looking for steady, passive income.\n\nIRA Financial\n\nSelf-directed investors looking to take greater control of their retirement savings may consider IRA Financial. The platform enables you to use a self-directed IRA or Solo 401(k) to invest in alternative assets such as real estate, private equity, or even crypto. This flexibility empowers retirement savers to go beyond traditional stocks and bonds, building diversified portfolios that align with their long-term wealth strategies.\n\nWiserAdvisor\n\nWiserAdvisor makes it easier to find a financial advisor who fits your needs. The platform matches you with vetted professionals based on your goals and investable assets, with a focus on those who have at least $100,000 to put to work. By comparing advisors through WiserAdvisor, investors can identify someone who aligns with their risk tolerance, retirement plans, and broader wealth strategy.\n\nAmerican Hartford Gold\n\nFor investors concerned about inflation or seeking portfolio protection, American Hartford Gold provides a simple way to buy and hold physical gold and silver within an IRA or direct delivery. With a minimum investment of $10,000, the platform caters to those looking to preserve wealth through precious metals while maintaining the option to diversify retirement accounts. It's a favored choice for conservative investors who want tangible assets that historically hold value during uncertain markets.\n\nThis article Bitcoin Could Plunge 40% Before Hitting $500K, Warns Anthony Scaramucci originally appeared on Benzinga.com\n\nView Comments",

            "content": "As the school year gets underway, teachers across the country are dealing with a pressing quandary: whether or not to use AI in the classroom.\n\nLudrick Cooper, an eighth-grade teacher in South Carolina, told CNN that he's been against the use of AI inside and outside the classroom for years, but is starting to change his tune.\n\n\"This is the new encyclopedia,\" he said of AI.\n\nDon't Miss:\n\nThe same firms that backed Uber, Venmo and eBay are investing in this pre-IPO company disrupting a $1.8T market — and you can too at just $2.90/share. They Sold Their Last Real Estate Company for Nearly $1B — Now They're Building the Future of U.S. Industrial Growth\n\nThere are certainly benefits to using AI in the classroom. It can make lessons more engaging, make access to information easier, and help with accessibility for those with visual impairments or conditions like dyslexia.\n\nHowever, experts also have concerns about the negative impacts AI can have on students. Widening education inequalities, mental health impacts, and easier methods of cheating are among the main downfalls of the technology.\n\n\"AI is a little bit like fire. When cavemen first discovered fire, a lot of people said, ‘Ooh, look what it can do,'\" University of Maine Associate Professor of Special Education Sarah Howorth told CNN. \"And other people are like, ‘Ah, it could kill us.' You know, it's the same with AI.\"\n\nSeveral existing platforms have developed specific AI tools to be used in the classroom. In July, OpenAI launched \"Study Mode,\" which offers students step-by-step guidance on classwork instead of just giving them an answer.\n\nTrending: Kevin O'Leary Says Real Estate's Been a Smart Bet for 200 Years — This Platform Lets Anyone Tap Into It\n\nThe company has also partnered with Instructure, the company behind the learning platform Canvas, to create a new tool called the LLM-Enabled Assignment. The tool will allow teachers to create AI-powered lessons while simultaneously tracking student progress.\n\n\"Now is the time to ensure AI benefits students, educators, and institutions, and partnerships like this are critical to making that happen,\" OpenAI Vice President of Education Leah Belsky said in a statement.\n\nWhile some teachers are excited by these advancements and the possibilities they create, others aren't quite sold.\n\nStanford University Vice Provost for Digital Education Matthew Rascoff worries that tools like this one remove the social aspect of education. By helping just one person at a time, AI tools don't allow opportunities for students to work on things like collaboration skills, which will be vital in their success as productive members of society.\n\nStory Continues\n\n\"Great classrooms create a sense of mutual responsibility for everybody's learning,\" he told CNN.\n\nSee Also: 7 Million Gamers Already Trust Gameflip With Their Digital Assets — Now You Can Own a Stake in the Platform\n\nLauren Monaco, a New York City pre-K and kindergarten teacher, also has concerns about the use of AI in the classroom. She sees AI as a crutch that keeps students from actually learning. In her perspective, teaching involves more than just the \"transactional information input-output\" of AI, she told CNN.\n\nFor Robin Lake, Arizona State University's Center on Reinventing Public Education director, the increase of AI use is a positive thing because of how prevalent it’s become in other areas of our lives.\n\n\"What are students going to need to be successful in an AI economy once they get out there?\" she told CNN. \"That's another issue that educators should be grappling with.\"\n\nRead Next: Wealth Managers Charge 1% or More in AUM Fees — Range's AI Platform Does It All for a Flat Fee (and Could Save You $10,000+ Annually).

            "content": "Alphabet’s GOOGL Google Services segment revenues are benefiting from higher advertising revenues that benefited from growth in revenues from Search and YouTube ads. GOOGL is advancing visual and contextual search capabilities, and AI Overviews now reach more than 2 billion users per month and are available in over 200 countries across 40 languages. AI is helping improve recommendations and auto dubbing on YouTube, which is expanding the target audience for creators and brands. \r\n\r\nAlphabet’s strategy of infusing AI-powered features on a continuous basis is attracting users. GOOGL recently unveiled a new image editing model from Google DeepMind in the Gemini app. Alphabet has been updating Gemini Live with new languages and countries. The latest updates allow Gemini to provide visual guidance by highlighting things directly on a user’s screen. Gemini can now connect apps that are used on a daily basis, like Google Calendar, Google Tasks, Google Keep, among others.\r\n\r\nGemini now leverages its advanced reasoning and multimodal capabilities to translate in real time. Alphabet’s advanced AI models currently support more than 70 languages, including Arabic, French, Hindi, Korean, Spanish and Tamil, for live conversation. \r\n\r\nThese new developments are expected to drive Google Services segment revenues that increased 11.7% year over year to $82.54 billion and accounted for 85.6% of second-quarter 2025 total revenues. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter 2025 Google Services revenues is pegged at $84.51 billion, indicating 10.5% growth from the figure reported in the year-ago quarter.\n\nGOOGL Faces Tough Competition\n\nAlphabet is facing stiff competition from the likes of Apple AAPL and Microsoft MSFT in the AI-powered services domain. \r\n\r\nApple is benefiting from the growing adoption of Apple Intelligence that is infused across iPhone, Mac, and iPad. In April, Apple expanded the availability of Apple Intelligence with iOS 18.4, iPadOS 18.4, and macOS Sequoia 15.4 updates in new languages, including French, German, Italian, Portuguese (Brazil), Spanish, Japanese, Korean, and Chinese (simplified), as well as localized English for Singapore and India. At the end of 2025, Apple Intelligence will be available in eight more languages: Danish, Dutch, Norwegian, Portuguese, Swedish, Turkish, Chinese (traditional) and Vietnamese.\r\n\r\nMicrosoft is keeping no stone unturned to improve the capabilities of Bing, its search engine. MSFT has been integrating AI into Bing thanks to its partnership with OpenAI. Microsoft introduced Copilot Search in Bing in April this year and launched Bing Video Creator in June. Tools like Azure OpenAI, Microsoft 365 Copilot and GitHub Copilot are becoming integral for enterprises looking to embed Generative AI into their workflows. Microsoft has integrated OpenAI’s GPT-5 across Microsoft 365, GitHub, Visual Studio and Azure AI Foundry, enabling smarter reasoning, real-time model routing and advanced coding.\n\nStory Continues\n\nGOOGL’s Share Price Performance, Valuation & Estimates\n\nAlphabet shares have appreciated 12.4% year to date, underperforming the broader Zacks Computer and Technology sector’s return of 12.9%.\n\nGOOGL Stock’s PerformanceZacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nThe GOOGL stock is trading at a premium, with a forward 12-month price/sales of 7.12X compared with the broader sector’s 6.66X.

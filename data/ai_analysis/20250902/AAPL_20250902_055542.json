            "content": "Maternity leave can be a nightmare to navigate when you're self-employed. Not only is it poorly paid, many of us worry that taking time off to recover and look after a baby can lead clients to go elsewhere. Pregnancy and new parenthood are never easy, but they can be especially uncertain and stressful when you work for yourself.\n\nSince 2008, the rise in self-employment in the UK has largely been driven by women. According to IPSE, there has been a 69% increase in the number of women freelancers, in part, because of the flexibility and autonomy it can offer. But, those who decide to have children often end up paying a high price for being self-employed.\n\nRead more: How to weigh the benefits and risks of disclosing a disability to your employer\n\n“When you’re self-employed, you are the business,” says Elizabeth Willetts, founder of Investing in Women, a UK job board and community connecting women with flexible, family-friendly employers.\n\n“Unlike traditional employment in someone else’s business, there’s no team automatically covering your workload while you step back. It can feel daunting to take time away. Many self-employed women worry about losing momentum, disappointing clients or seeing contracts disappear while they recover and care for their baby.”\n\nIn the UK, self-employed mothers face added challenges because maternity allowance is even less generous than statutory maternity pay – which is already lower than in most developed countries.\n\nRead more: Should you quit a job before finding another?\n\nWhile employed mothers receive 90% of their average weekly earnings (before tax) for the first six weeks, self-employed mothers miss out on this higher initial payment. This can make it much harder to take time off, as the lower rate of support leaves many feeling pressured to keep working.\n\nBut, says founder of Rise & Lead Women Ebere Akadiri, maternity leave is just a temporary pause. And with some careful planning, you can keep your clients and work while taking the time needed to recover and look after a baby.\n\n“As a business strategist, I’ve seen many women navigate this challenging season successfully by planning ahead, setting clear expectations early, and leveraging support to maintain both their business and client trust during maternity leave,” says Akadiri. “Women should not have to choose between their business and motherhood.”\n\nUse your ‘keep in touch’ days wisely\n\nKIT (keep in touch) days are designed to let you do some work while still receiving maternity allowance. You can work up to 10 KIT days without affecting your payments. But remember, any amount of work done on a single day counts as a full KIT day.\n\nStory Continues\n\n“These days can be used flexibly – for example, for a few hours to attend a client meeting or for a full day on a project,” says Willetts. “Used wisely, KIT days are a fantastic tool for client retention. Westend61 via Getty Images\n\n“You might use one to attend a key client meeting, deliver an important piece of work, or simply check in with clients to reassure them they’re still a priority. The value isn’t just in the output, but in the signal it sends – that you’re still engaged and thinking of their needs, even while on leave. That reassurance goes a long way to maintaining trust and loyalty.”\n\nHowever, you can’t work beyond those 10 days without it affecting your maternity payments. It's also a good idea to keep a record of when and how much work you complete on your KIT days, even if the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) doesn't require proof of earnings for the days worked.\n\nCommunicate with your clients\n\nLet clients know your plans well ahead of time, including when you’ll be stepping back, your availability during leave and when you expect to return. Of course, plans can change. If you may need more time to recover physically and mentally after the birth, let your clients know as soon as you’re able to.\n\nRead more: How to close the menopause pay gap\n\nSetting boundaries is essential when you’ve just had a baby, whether it’s with keen relatives wanting to visit, or with your clients.\n\n“You can set boundaries but offer reassurance,” says Willetts. “Clients appreciate honesty. Be clear about what you can and can’t do, but reassure them you’re committed to supporting their needs long-term.”\n\nPlan cover if possible\n\nIf you can, partner with a trusted freelancer or associate who can step in temporarily.\n\nThe benefit of doing this that clients still feel supported while you take a proper break to look after your newborn.\n\nSet up automated systems\n\nWhere possible, set up systems well in advance so clients feel looked after even if you’re not immediately available. “Use email auto-replies, invoicing tools, and scheduling software to handle routine tasks while you’re away,” says Akadiri.\n\nSchedule things like newsletters and social posts ahead of time to maintain visibility. “With smart strategies, you can maintain client relationships and keep your business moving while prioritising your recovery and family. Motherhood doesn’t have to mean pausing your ambitions; it means finding new, flexible ways to make them work.”\n\nRead more:\n\nHow to stay motivated during a long job hunt How to give your job applications a 'human touch' in the AI era How to apply for jobs when you're pregnant\n\nDownload the Yahoo Finance app, available for Apple and Android.\n\nView Comments",

            "title": "Higher earners are under saving for retirement, according to data",
            "content": "The latest analysis from the Hargreaves Lansdown Savings and Resilience Barometer makes for a sobering reading when it comes to our retirement readiness. According to the data, only 43% of households are currently on track for an adequate retirement income, with the gap looming particularly large for higher income households.\n\nSo, what do I mean when I talk about an “adequate retirement income”? That will mean different things to different people and because of this, we measure it using what is known as a target replacement rate.\n\nA target replacement rate is where you save enough to give you an income that hits a specific percentage of your pre-retirement salary – for instance two-thirds. So, for example, if you earned £30,000 while at work, you would need an income of £20,000 in retirement. This means that you can sustain your existing lifestyle in retirement as your expenses will be likely be lower.\n\nUsing this approach, we see that higher earners are under saving and could face a nasty shock in retirement. We estimate the pension gap stands at around £64,800 for the top fifth earning households. This could be because many assume saving at auto-enrolment minimums will get them where they need to be, but the reality is that they need to save far more than this.\n\nIt’s an issue the government will need to get to grips with in its work on pension adequacy, with thought given to how this group can be incentivised to save more for their future. In the interim, it’s worth using a pensions calculator to see where you stand, and whether you need to boost contributions to get back on track.Only 43% of households are currently on track for an adequate retirement income, according to data.·MoMo Productions via Getty Images\n\nThe picture is not so stark for lower earners, with the pension gap standing at £1,250 for the bottom fifth earning households. This is because the new state pension combined with auto-enrolment minimum contributions will get them close to where they need to be.\n\nWith this in mind, care needs to be taken that any increase in minimum contributions designed to help higher earners does not put the finances of lower earning groups under undue pressure.\n\nWhat about non-pension assets?\n\nHowever, there can be more to retirement than pension savings, and taking these other assets into account can have a big impact on our resilience. Just over two in five households (42%) report holding some form of non-pension investment. Specifically, 38% of households have a pension and investments. Another 4% have no pension but investments.\n\nThe self-employed — who typically have much lower pension adequacy scores compared to employed households — experience the largest gains when these additional assets are factored in.\n\nStory Continues\n\nRead more: Mortgage approvals tick higher amid interest rate hope cuts\n\nNearly half (47%) of self-employed households would reach retirement adequacy using this measure, compared to 36% if just pensions were used. This compares to 54% of employed households achieving adequacy when non-pension assets are accounted for, compared to 46% if just pensions are used.\n\nThis is because self-employed people are more likely to invest in assets outside of a pension due to concerns about being unable to access pension money until at least the age of 55.\n\nWe have long championed the use of the lifetime ISA (LISA) for this group. The 25% government bonus acts in the same way as basic rate tax relief on a pension, and income can be taken tax free. Importantly, money can be accessed in an emergency – albeit subject to a 25% exit penalty.\n\nWe believe the LISA could be made even more attractive by expanding the current age criteria beyond the age of 40 and reducing the exit penalty to 20%, which would only remove the government bonus without unduly penalising diligent savers.\n\nRead more:\n\nHow to tell if you should invest your money Best savings account deals that still pay more than inflation What happens to your pension if your relationship ends?\n\nDownload the Yahoo Finance app, available for Apple and Android.\n\nView Comments",

            "title": "The U.S. Government Just Took a 9% Stake in Intel. Here's Why That's Both Bad and Good News For Shareholders.",
            "content": "Key Points\n\nOn Aug. 22, the government announced it was converting Intel's CHIPS Act grants into an equity stake.  Shareholders will be diluted about 8.9%, and over 10% when factoring another $2 billion investment by Softbank. Despite the dilution, the stock went up on the news -- and there may be a very good reason for it. 10 stocks we like better than Intel ›\n\nOn Friday, Aug. 22, the Trump administration announced that the U.S. government would be converting $8.87 billion in CHIPS Act grant money that had been awarded to Intel(NASDAQ: INTC) into equity in the company. The government will receive just over 433 million shares at $20.47, good for about 8.85% of Intel when factoring in another recent investment by Japanese tech giant Softbank(OTC: SFTB.Y).\n\nNeedless to say, it's unusual for the U.S. government to take a stake in a major company; it's the type of thing one may find common in other countries, but typically not in the USA, the center of \"free market capitalism.\"\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now. Continue »\n\nLeaving out the philosophical issue of how much government should be involved in the private sector, is the deal a good one for Intel shareholders?\n\nThe Bad\n\n\"Free\" money turned out not to be so free\n\nWhile some have posited the government is throwing Intel a \"lifeline,\" Intel was already supposed to receive this money without having to offer any shares in return. CHIPS Act grants were essentially subsidies to be paid out upon the completion of certain construction milestones for U.S.-based manufacturing fabs.\n\nWhile Intel had only completed part of that buildout and other parts were still up in the air, the fact remains that CHIPS Act grants were supposed to be subsidies for projects Intel was likely to execute at some point. However, language in Intel's recent quarterly report suggested the Trump administration might not pay the funds out as prescribed by law, even as Intel is currently struggling with cash flow.\n\nWhile we don't really know the dynamics behind the negotiations, we do know that at the end, money Intel was supposed to receive in return for its chip buildout had been converted to equity after the fact, flouting the CHIPS Act as it was intended. That legally dubious maneuver diluted shareholders who weren't expecting it, which really isn't a great precedent.\n\nU.S. involvement may be a risk to international sales\n\nIn the \"risks\" section to the filing, Intel noted that the government's stake could put some of Intel's overseas sales at risk. That could be significant, as 76% of all Intel sales were in international markets, according to the filing.\n\nWhile it may seem a long shot that a customer may choose another chip over Intel solely because of the government's involvement, it's not inconceivable. After all, China just told local businesses to stop buying the Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) H20 chip, shortly after the Trump administration said the government would take 15% of all H20 sales to China, and administration official Howard Lutnick said the goal was to get Chinese developers \"addicted to the American technology stack.\"\n\nThe government will go along with the board\n\nSome free market purists may have taken comfort in the fact that the government pledged not to get involved in shareholder votes and therefore won't be dictating strategy to the company. However, that doesn't mean the government's stake won't have an impact.\n\nIn the agreement, the government agreed to vote along with the board of directors when it comes to all proposals and nominees. That means the government won't come in and impose its own agenda, but it will add to the power of the board.\n\nHistory has shown that boards of directors are notoriously bad at policing themselves. Should Intel's board engage in any bad practices that outside shareholders disagree with, those shareholders will have a harder time making changes or decisions against the board's preferences.\n\nSome have criticized Intel's board in recent years, with some shareholders noting that many members were on the board during Intel's fall from grace during the 2010s. Others have complained about the board's lack of semiconductor business experience, while others questioned last year's firing of CEO Pat Gelsinger.\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nThe Good\n\nIntel gets the money now, without conditions\n\nIntel received the first $5.7 billion of the money last week, with the remaining $3.2 billion to come as Intel fulfills commitments under the Secure Enclave program, whereby it will produce chips for the U.S. military. So Intel gets help with its balance sheet now, instead of having to build and complete projects in the future on an uncertain timeline. That could certainly put potential customers' minds at ease when deciding whether to use Intel as their foundry.\n\nIn addition, Intel is free of other burdens, such as certain workforce requirements spelled out in the CHIPS Act. And Intel is also now freed from an \"excess profits\" clause, whereby it would have to pay cash flow above a certain threshold for each funded project back to the government.\n\nSo while shareholders are diluted, if Intel does become wildly successful in foundry, there may now be more upside than there was before.\n\nThe government could help \"nudge\" customers to use IFS\n\nWhile it's unlikely the government will directly force chip customers to use Intel, it's possible the government's stake could spur customers to choose Intel over Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing(NYSE: TSM) if customers are on the fence and having to make a close choice.\n\nAfter all, major tech companies such as Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) have announced large U.S. investments to get on the administration's good side, so one could easily see a scenario whereby a customer shifts at least some production to Intel's foundry, IFS, as a gesture of goodwill.\n\nMoreover, the Trump administration has been open to using \"sticks\" as motivators to get companies to build more in the United States. Using Intel's foundry may be a way to get around restrictions, tariffs, or unique taxes the government might otherwise impose in the future.\n\nSoftbank's $2 billion might not have come without government backing\n\nIt was interesting that just before the announcement of the government's investment, Intel announced a $2 billion equity investment from Japanese tech conglomerate Softbank just a few days prior.\n\nLike the government's stake, Softbank's investment is for Intel equity, not just the foundry. And also like the government's investment, there were no apparent \"strings\" attached. However, it seems likely Softbank will steer one or more of its portfolio companies to use Intel foundry in the future.\n\nMost notably, Softbank owns 90% of Arm Holdings(NASDAQ: ARM), whose chip architecture is used in a variety of low-power applications, such as smartphones and certain data center chips. Arm has reportedly been contemplating building its own AI chips. If that homegrown chip plan comes to fruition, it's possible Arm could use Intel foundry to build them.\n\nSoftbank has also made other big AI-related announcements this year. In May, it announced the acquisition of private AI chip company Ampere for $6.5 billion. Interestingly, Ampere's founder and CEO is an ex-Intel executive. Softbank is also collaborating with OpenAI on several AI ventures, including Stargate, the massive $500 billion AI data center infrastructure project based in the United States. Another is Cristal Intelligence, an enterprise-focused AI solution co-developed by both Softbank and OpenAI.\n\nAt last week's Deutsche Bank technology conference, CFO David Zinsner said it was a \"coincidence\" that Softbank had invested in the same week as the U.S. government. However, the timing does raise questions as to whether Softbank would have directly invested had the government not been in talks already. And if Intel needs to raise more money in the future for its 14A buildout, the government's involvement may also give confidence to future investors.\n\nIntel may have something cooking\n\nFinally, the government's investment could show confidence in Intel's technology. While it's true that Intel was owed this money anyway, the government also could have continued withholding the money if it didn't think Intel had any hope for a turnaround.\n\nWhile we can't know what Lip-Bu Tan and other Intel executives discussed with the administration, it's clear that the administration gained more confidence in Intel over the past few weeks, with President Trump at first insisting on Tan's firing, only to then invest billions of dollars alongside him after their meeting.\n\nCould Intel be on the brink if better things? Remember, Intel's 18A node was supposed to achieve technological equality with TSMC after a decade of underperformance, and 18A is set for its first production later this year, with Intel's Panther Lake CPU. 18A sports new innovations such as backside power, which TSMC won't introduce until later this decade, as well as gate-all-around transistors. There is also the possibility that Intel is going to use high-NA EUV technology on 18A, even though Intel originally slated high-NA use for its future node, 14A. After all, Intel has already purchased several high-NA machines and was the first company do so.\n\nIn any case, with Intel's first 18A chip due out later this year, it's possible the government saw improvement on the horizon.\n\nThe good appears to outweigh the bad\n\nWhile the government's investment is certainly a strange turn of events, it seems the potential \"goods\" outweigh the \"bads\" at this point.\n\nThat's because the most important element here is Intel's ability to land customers for its foundry. If more customers sign up for IFS than they otherwise would have based on the government's stake, then the deal was likely to be worth it.\n\nThat's probably why, despite the shareholder dilution, Intel's stock went up on the news.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Intel right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Intel, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Intel wasn’t one of them.

            "content": "Dollar Tree, Inc.DLTR is likely to register a decline in its top and bottom lines when it reports second-quarter fiscal 2025 results on Sept. 3, before the market opens. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $4.5 billion, indicating a drop of 39.6% from the prior-year quarter’s figure.\r\n\r\nThe consensus estimate for earnings is pegged at 38 cents per share, indicating a decrease of 43.3% from the year-ago period’s figure. The consensus mark has increased 2 cents in the past 30 days.\r\n \r\nDLTR has a trailing four-quarter negative earnings surprise of 6.9%, on average. In the last reported quarter, the Chesapeake, VA-based company’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 5.9%.\n\nTrends to Watch Before Dollar Tree’s Q2 Release\n\nDollar Tree’s second-quarter fiscal 2025 is likely to be weighed down by near-term challenges despite a strong start to the year. The company expects continued pressure on discretionary demand in the quarter under discussion as the quarter traditionally lacks major seasonal sales drivers compared with the second halves of the year. Adverse foreign currency translations also continue to act as deterrents.\r\n\r\nTo mitigate these impacts, Dollar Tree is actively deploying its five levers of cost management, including supplier negotiations, product re-specifications, shifting sourcing to alternative countries, eliminating uneconomical items and leveraging its multi-price strategy. While these measures should offset much of the tariff impact over time, transitional inefficiencies and the lag in execution are likely to weigh on the fiscal second-quarter results.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the company anticipates higher selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses in the quarter due to incremental labor and store investments aimed at supporting stronger execution and future growth. These combined headwinds, softer discretionary demand, tariff-driven cost pressures and elevated SG&A expenses are expected to result in a sharp year-over-year decline in earnings for the to-be-reported quarter.\r\n\r\nOn the last reported quarter’searnings call management expected comparable net sales growth toward the higher end of its full-year outlook of 3-5%. DLTR envisions second-quarter adjusted EPS from continuing operations to decline 45-50% year over year, before accelerating again in the third and fourth quarters to achieve the fiscal 2025 earnings outlook.\r\n\r\nOn the positive front, Dollar Tree is expected to have displayed continued progress on its expansion initiatives, marked by steady store openings and investments in distribution centers, which likely supported revenue momentum. The pending sale of Family Dollar also positions the company to sharpen its operational focus and improve cash flow, further strengthening its growth trajectory.\n\nDollar Tree’s Zacks Model Findings\n\nOur proven model conclusively predicts an earnings beat for Dollar Tree this time around. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of an earnings beat, which is exactly the case here. You can uncover the best stocks before they are reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.\r\n\r\nDollar Tree has an Earnings ESP of +7.90% and currently carries a Zacks Rank of 3.\n\nDLTR’s Stock Price & Valuation Picture\n\nFrom a valuation perspective, Dollar Tree shares present an attractive opportunity, trading at a discount relative to historical and industry benchmarks. With a forward 12-month price-to-earnings ratio of 18.31X, above the five-year median of 17.76X and below the Retail-Discount Stores industry’s average of 31.77X, the company’s shares offer compelling value for investors seeking exposure to the sector.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nRecent market movements show that Dollar Tree’s shares have gained 19.7% in the past three months against the industry’s 3.7% decline.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nOther Stocks With the Favorable Combination\n\nAmerican Eagle OutfittersAEO currently has an Earnings ESP of +7.69% and a Zacks Rank of 3.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its quarterly revenues is pegged at $34.12 billion, which indicates a 0.6% rise from the figure reported in the year-ago quarter.\r\n\r\nThe company is expected to register an increase in the bottom line. The consensus estimate for Kroger’s second-quarter earnings is pegged at $1.00 per share, up 7.5% from the year-ago quarter. KR delivered a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 3.5%, on average.\r\n\r\nTorrid Holdings CURV presently has an Earnings ESP of +71.43% and a Zacks Rank of 2. The company is likely to register a decline in both top and bottom lines when it reports second-quarter fiscal 2025 results. The consensus mark for CURV’s quarterly revenues is pegged at $259.6 million, which indicates an 8.8% decline from the figure reported in the prior-year quarter.\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for second-quarter earnings per share is pegged at 3 cents, which indicates a decrease of 50% from the year-ago quarter’s actual.

            "content": "American Eagle Outfitters, Inc. AEO is scheduled to report second-quarter fiscal 2025 results on Sept. 3, after the opening bell.\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for AEO’s fiscal second-quarter revenues is pegged at $1.2 billion, suggesting a 4.5% decline from the year-ago quarter.

Moreover, the company has delivered a negative earnings surprise of 0.3%, on average, in the trailing four quarters.\n\nEarnings Whispers for AEO Stock\n\nOur proven model conclusively predicts an earnings beat for American Eagle this time around. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat, which is exactly the case here. You can uncover the best stocks before they are reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.\r\n\r\nAmerican Eagle has an Earnings ESP of +7.69% and carries a Zacks Rank of 3 at present.\n\nThings to Know About AEO’s Upcoming Results\n\nAmerican Eagle’s second-quarter fiscal 2025 results are likely to be negatively impacted by persistent macroeconomic pressures that are weighing on consumer discretionary spending. Elevated household debt, inflationary headwinds and ongoing uncertainty around employment are dampening consumer confidence, particularly among its core demographic of younger, price-sensitive shoppers. As a result, spending on non-essential categories like apparel is expected to remain subdued, affecting both traffic and conversion in stores and online.\r\n\r\nMerchandising missteps remain one of the biggest hurdles. At Aerie, categories like lace tops and shorts failed to resonate with customers, while at American Eagle, out-of-stocks in core denim and weakness in men’s pants and shorts constrained growth. Although certain categories, such as women’s denim and fleece, performed well, overall product performance was uneven, forcing the company to rely more heavily on markdowns that further hurt profitability.\r\n\r\nAnother significant challenge lies in margin pressure. Beyond the inventory write-down, higher product costs, increased freight expenses and elevated promotional activity weighed on profitability. Tariffs also remain a looming headwind, with management estimating about $40 million in costs this year, a portion of which will impact the fiscal second quarter. While some mitigation is underway, continued pricing pressure and the need to clear seasonal goods suggest margin recovery may take time.\r\n\r\nOn the last reported quarter’searnings call management expected the top-line trend in the fiscal second quarter to be similar to the first quarter. For the second quarter of fiscal 2025, the company expects revenues to decline 5% and comps to decrease 3%. Gross margin is projected to be down year over year, thanks to an increase in in-season markdowns and a deleveraged BOW cost on lower comps. Operating income is anticipated to be $40-$45 million for the said quarter.\r\n\r\nDespite these challenges, AEO has taken corrective actions that could strengthen performance in the back half of the year. Inventory levels are better aligned with current demand, assortments are being refined to emphasize proven categories like denim, intimates and activewear, and sourcing diversification should ease tariff exposure. Marketing investments are being ramped up ahead of back-to-school, and capital spending is being paced more carefully to preserve cash while still supporting growth. These steps position AEO to stabilize results and rebuild momentum heading into the fall and holiday seasons.\n\nAEO’s Valuation Picture\n\nFrom a valuation perspective, American Eagle’s shares present an attractive opportunity, trading at a discount relative to historical and industry benchmarks. With a forward 12-month price-to-earnings ratio of 12.58X, below the Retail-Apparel & Shoes industry’s average of 18.67X, the stock offers compelling value for investors seeking exposure to the sector.\n\nAEO Stock's Valuation\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nThe recent market movements show that American Eagle’s shares have gained 5.3% in the past six months compared with the industry's growth of 5.6%.\n\nAEO Stock's Price Performance\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nOther Stocks With the Favorable Combination\n\nDollar Tree Inc.DLTR currently has an Earnings ESP of +7.90% and a Zacks Rank of 3.

While some mitigation is underway, continued pricing pressure and the need to clear seasonal goods suggest margin recovery may take time.\r\n\r\nOn the last reported quarter’s earnings call, management expected the top-line trend in the fiscal second quarter to be similar to the first quarter. For the second quarter of fiscal 2025, the company expects revenues to decline 5% and comps to decrease 3%. Gross margin is projected to be down year over year, thanks to an increase in in-season markdowns and a deleveraged BOW cost on lower comps. Operating income is anticipated to be $40-$45 million for the said quarter.\r\n\r\nDespite these challenges, AEO has taken corrective actions that could strengthen performance in the back half of the year. Inventory levels are better aligned with current demand, assortments are being refined to emphasize proven categories like denim, intimates and activewear, and sourcing diversification should ease tariff exposure. Marketing investments are being ramped up ahead of back-to-school, and capital spending is being paced more carefully to preserve cash while still supporting growth. These steps position AEO to stabilize results and rebuild momentum heading into the fall and holiday seasons.\n\nStory Continues\n\nAEO’s Valuation Picture\n\nFrom a valuation perspective, American Eagle’s shares present an attractive opportunity, trading at a discount relative to historical and industry benchmarks. With a forward 12-month price-to-earnings ratio of 12.58X, below the Retail-Apparel & Shoes industry’s average of 18.67X, the stock offers compelling value for investors seeking exposure to the sector.\n\nAEO Stock's ValuationZacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nThe recent market movements show that American Eagle’s shares have gained 5.3% in the past six months compared with the industry's growth of 5.6%.\n\nAEO Stock's Price PerformanceZacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nOther Stocks With the Favorable Combination\n\nDollar Tree Inc.

            "title": "Samsara Set to Report Q2 Earnings: What's in Store for the Stock?",
            "content": "Samsara Inc. IOT is scheduled to report second-quarter fiscal 2026 results on Sept. 4.\n\nFor the second quarter of fiscal 2026, management expects non-GAAP earnings per share between 6 cents and 7 cents. The consensus mark is pegged at 7 cents per share, indicating an increase of 40% from the prior-year quarter’s reported figure. The estimate has remained unchanged over the past 60 days.\n\nSamsara’s earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in each of the trailing four quarters, delivering an average earnings surprise of 153.8%.\n\nFor the second quarter of fiscal 2026, Samsara expects revenues between $371 million and $373 million. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $372 million, suggesting growth of approximately 24% from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure.\n\nSamsara Inc. Price and EPS Surprise\n\nSamsara Inc. price-eps-surprise | Samsara Inc. Quote\n\nFactors to Influence Samsara’s Q2 Results\n\nSamsara’s fiscal second-quarter performance is expected to have benefited from scaling of its AI-powered connected platform, multiproduct adoption, OEM partnerships, strong ARR expansion, and margin leverage.\n\nAI continues to be a key growth catalyst for IOT as a rising number of construction, logistics, transportation and public sector entities are adopting AI-powered solutions for safety, maintenance, and workflow management to optimize operations and fleet management.\n\nSamsara’s AI-based solutions have been reducing accidents, improving maintenance, and extending asset lifespan for its customers and this has been a key growth driver in the first quarter of fiscal 2026, when Samsara crossed the $1.54 billion in ARR, up 31% year over year. This trend is likely to continue in the upcoming quarterly results.\n\nAs Samsara collaborates with leading OEMs of the world and uses worker training & gamification in its offerings, this will benefit the company in enhancing adoption and retention in the to be reported quarter. These factors are likely to have improved Samsara’s ACV in the to-be-reported quarter.\n\nHowever, tariff-driven uncertainty, elongated enterprise sales cycles, regional competition in Europe, and reliance on large accounts are expected to have remained headwinds for the company in the to-be-reported quarter.\n\nEarnings Whispers for IOT Stock\n\nOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for IOT this time. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat, which is not the case here.\n\nThough IOT carries a Zacks Rank #3 at present, it has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they are reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.\n\nStory Continues\n\nStocks With the Favorable Combination\n\nHere are some stocks worth considering, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to beat on earnings this reporting cycle.\n\nMicron Technology MU has an Earnings ESP of +1.37% and sports a Zacks Rank #1 at present. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\n\nMicron Technology shares have surged 41.5% year to date.

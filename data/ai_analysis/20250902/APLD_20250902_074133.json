Sometimes research that changes the investing world can come from the halls of academia. Partha Mohanram is a great example of this. While academic research has shown that value investing works over time, it has found the opposite for growth investing. Mohanram turned that research on its head by developing a growth model that produced significant market outperformance. His research paper \"Separating Winners from Losers among Low Book-to-Market Stocks using Financial Statement Analysis\" looked at the criteria that can be used to separate growth stocks that continue their upward trajectory from those that don't. Mohanram is currently the John H. Watson Chair in Value Investing at the University of Toronto and was previously an Associate Professor at the Columbia Business School.\n\nAdditional Research Links\n\nTop NASDAQ 100 Stocks\n\nTop Technology Stocks\n\nTop Large-Cap Growth Stocks\n\nHigh Momentum Stocks\n\nTop Chip Stocks\n\nHigh Insider Ownership Stocks\n\nAbout Validea: Validea is aninvestment researchservice that follows the published strategies of investment legends.

            "title": "Orion, Blink Charging, Applied Digital, Domo, and Urban Outfitters Shares Are Falling, What You Need To Know",
            "content": "What Happened?\n\nA number of stocks fell in the afternoon session after markets pulled back with the decline concentrated in the tech space as investors engaged in profit-taking following a robust week that saw the S&P 500 hit a new record.\n\nAdding to the pressure, new inflation data, specifically the Core PCE, showed an acceleration in July, signaling that rising prices remain a risk despite being in line with expectations. This confluence of factors, including market highs heading into a historically weak September, led to a pullback, with the Nasdaq Composite shedding 1.15%. While the Federal Reserve has hinted at potential rate cuts, the focus on inflation and the jobs market continues to influence investor sentiment.\n\nThe stock market overreacts to news, and big price drops can present good opportunities to buy high-quality stocks.\n\nAmong others, the following stocks were impacted:\n\nConstruction and Maintenance Services company Orion (NYSE:ORN) fell 3.1%.

Apparel Retailer company Urban Outfitters (NASDAQ:URBN) fell 3.4%. Is now the time to buy Urban Outfitters? Access our full analysis report here, it’s free.\n\nZooming In On Domo (DOMO)\n\nDomo’s shares are extremely volatile and have had 30 moves greater than 5% over the last year. In that context, today’s move indicates the market considers this news meaningful but not something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business.\n\nThe previous big move we wrote about was 2 days ago when the stock gained 8.4% on the news that the company announced it signed a strategic collaboration agreement with Amazon Web Services (AWS) to accelerate the adoption of generative artificial intelligence solutions.\n\nThe partnership is designed to help mutual customers of both companies build AI-powered solutions by leveraging Domo's AI platform and AWS's cloud infrastructure. The collaboration specifically centers on Domo AI, the company's suite of AI tools that includes features like natural language querying and automated insights. This positive development follows other recent good news for the company. Just a day prior, analysts at TD Cowen upgraded Domo's stock rating to Buy from Hold and significantly raised their price target, citing a belief that the company is \"turning the corner\" on key strategic initiatives that could drive sustained growth.\n\nStory Continues\n\nDomo is up 107% since the beginning of the year, but at $14.69 per share, it is still trading 16.4% below its 52-week high of $17.57 from August 2025. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of Domo’s shares 5 years ago would now be looking at an investment worth $360.76.\n\nHere at StockStory, we certainly understand the potential of thematic investing. Diverse winners from Microsoft (MSFT) to Alphabet (GOOG), Coca-Cola (KO) to Monster Beverage (MNST) could all have been identified as promising growth stories with a megatrend driving the growth. So, in that spirit, we’ve identified a relatively under-the-radar profitable growth stock benefiting from the rise of AI, available to you FREE via this link.\n\nView Comments",

            "title": "Applied Digital (APLD) Expands Presence with US$11 Billion CoreWeave Lease in North Dakota",
            "content": "Applied Digital recently signed a new lease agreement with CoreWeave, expanding its capacity at the Polaris Forge 1 Campus and reaching an anticipated contracted lease revenue of $11 billion. This significant business expansion aligns with APLD’s share price surge of 143% last quarter. The broader tech market faced declines, with the S&P 500 and Dow retreating slightly and tech stocks like Nvidia and Broadcom declining. This backdrop makes APLD’s rise remarkable, suggesting the lease deal strengthened investor confidence despite mixed tech sector trends. The expansion could have added weight to the broader positive sentiment surrounding growth-oriented tech initiatives.\n\nWe've identified 3 possible red flags for Applied Digital (1 doesn't sit too well with us) that you should be aware of.APLD Revenue & Expenses Breakdown as at Aug 2025\n\nUncover the next big thing with financially sound penny stocks that balance risk and reward.\n\nThe recent lease agreement with CoreWeave marks a significant development for Applied Digital (APLD), as it positions the company for long-term revenue growth through a predictable leasing stream. This agreement could bolster APLD’s ability to meet its anticipated growth in hyper-scale AI demand, directly impacting revenue and earnings forecasts. Over the next few years, this could contribute to margin expansion as the company capitalizes on efficient building processes and strategic locations, refining its position in the AI infrastructure landscape. Analysts forecast APLD's revenue to grow 47.1% annually, which highlights the potential impact of such partnerships in enhancing this trajectory.\n\nOver a five-year period, APLD's total shareholder return stands at a very large increase of 26761.28%, significantly outperforming one-year industry and market benchmarks, where it exceeded both the US IT industry and the broader US market, which returned 18.9% and 17.2%, respectively. Such impressive long-term performance contrasts with the high volatility observed in recent months, suggesting that the company's strategic initiatives may have been well-received by investors.\n\nGiven the current share price of US$16.60 and the consensus analyst price target of US$19.38, there remains potential upside of 16.7%. This price movement implies investor optimism about the company’s future prospects, though investor caution is warranted considering the inherent volatility and financial risks identified in its reliance on debt and concentrated customer base. Nonetheless, the anticipated growth in revenues and potential margin improvements could help APLD align more closely with market expectations, as indicated by the analyst forecasts.\n\nStory Continues\n\nEvaluate Applied Digital's historical performance by accessing our past performance report.\n\nThis article by Simply Wall St is general in nature.

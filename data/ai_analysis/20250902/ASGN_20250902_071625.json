            "content": "Let’s dig into the relative performance of Accenture (NYSE:ACN) and its peers as we unravel the now-completed Q2 it services & consulting earnings season.\n\nIT Services & Consulting companies stand to benefit from increasing enterprise demand for digital transformation, AI-driven automation, and cybersecurity resilience. Many enterprises can't attack these topics alone and need IT services and consulting on everything from technical advice to implementation. Challenges in meeting these needs will include finding talent in specialized and evolving IT fields. While AI and automation can enhance productivity, they also threaten to commoditize certain consulting functions. Another ongoing challenge will be pricing pressures from offshore IT service providers, which have lower labor costs and increasingly equal access to advanced technology like AI.\n\nThe 8 it services & consulting stocks we track reported a mixed Q2. As a group, revenues beat analysts’ consensus estimates by 1.3% while next quarter’s revenue guidance was 0.5% below.\n\nAmidst this news, share prices of the companies have had a rough stretch. On average, they are down 6.3% since the latest earnings results.\n\nAccenture (NYSE:ACN)\n\nWith a workforce of approximately 774,000 people serving clients in more than 120 countries, Accenture (NYSE:ACN) is a professional services firm that helps organizations transform their businesses through consulting, technology, operations, and digital services.\n\nAccenture reported revenues of $17.73 billion, up 7.7% year on year. This print exceeded analysts’ expectations by 2.3%. Overall, it was a satisfactory quarter for the company with a beat of analysts’ EPS estimates but revenue guidance for next quarter meeting analysts’ expectations.Accenture Total Revenue\n\nUnsurprisingly, the stock is down 15.1% since reporting and currently trades at $259.86.\n\nIs now the time to buy Accenture?

The business had a strong quarter with an impressive beat of analysts’ EPS guidance for next quarter estimates and a solid beat of analysts’ constant currency revenue estimates.EPAM Total Revenue\n\nThe market seems happy with the results as the stock is up 16.4% since reporting. It currently trades at $176.36.\n\nStory Continues\n\nIs now the time to buy EPAM?

Still, it was a softer quarter as it posted a significant miss of analysts’ full-year EPS guidance estimates.\n\nInterestingly, the stock is up 8.5% since the results and currently trades at $54.25.\n\nRead our full analysis of ASGN’s results here.\n\nKyndryl (NYSE:KD)\n\nBorn from IBM's managed infrastructure services business in a 2021 spinoff, Kyndryl (NYSE:KD) is the world's largest IT infrastructure services provider that designs, builds, and manages technology environments for enterprise customers.\n\nKyndryl reported revenues of $3.74 billion, flat year on year. This result missed analysts’ expectations by 1.5%. It was a slower quarter as it also produced revenue guidance for next quarter missing analysts’ expectations.\n\nKyndryl had the weakest performance against analyst estimates among its peers. The stock is down 12.9% since reporting and currently trades at $31.96.\n\nRead our full, actionable report on Kyndryl here, it’s free.\n\nIBM (NYSE:IBM)\n\nWith a corporate history spanning over a century and once known for its iconic mainframe computers, IBM (NYSE:IBM) provides hybrid cloud computing platforms, AI solutions, consulting services, and enterprise infrastructure to help businesses modernize their operations.\n\nIBM reported revenues of $16.98 billion, up 7.7% year on year. This number topped analysts’ expectations by 2.4%.

Fortunately (miraculously to some), all this tightening didn’t send the economy tumbling into a recession, so here we are, cautiously celebrating a soft landing. The cherry on top? Recent rate cuts (half a point in September 2024, a quarter in November) have propped up markets, especially after Trump’s November win lit a fire under major indices and sent them to all-time highs. However, there’s still plenty to ponder — tariffs, corporate tax cuts, and what 2025 might hold for the economy.\n\nWant to invest in winners with rock-solid fundamentals?

            "content": "Small-cap stocks can be incredibly lucrative investments because their lack of analyst coverage leads to frequent mispricings. However, these businesses (and their stock prices) often stay small because their subscale operations make it harder to expand their competitive moats.\n\nThese trade-offs can cause headaches for even the most seasoned professionals, which is why we started StockStory - to help you separate the good companies from the bad.

            "title": "The three-year loss for ASGN (NYSE:ASGN) shareholders likely driven by its shrinking earnings",
            "content": "For many investors, the main point of stock picking is to generate higher returns than the overall market. But the risk of stock picking is that you will likely buy under-performing companies. We regret to report that long term ASGN Incorporated (NYSE:ASGN) shareholders have had that experience, with the share price dropping 46% in three years, versus a market return of about 64%. The more recent news is of little comfort, with the share price down 44% in a year.\n\nOn a more encouraging note the company has added US$104m to its market cap in just the last 7 days, so let's see if we can determine what's driven the three-year loss for shareholders.\n\nTrump has pledged to \"unleash\" American oil and gas and these 15 US stocks have developments that are poised to benefit.\n\nThere is no denying that markets are sometimes efficient, but prices do not always reflect underlying business performance. By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.\n\nASGN saw its EPS decline at a compound rate of 15% per year, over the last three years. This fall in EPS isn't far from the rate of share price decline, which was 18% per year. So it seems like sentiment towards the stock hasn't changed all that much over time. It seems like the share price is reflecting the declining earnings per share.\n\nYou can see how EPS has changed over time in the image below (click on the chart to see the exact values).NYSE:ASGN Earnings Per Share Growth August 24th 2025\n\nThis free interactive report on ASGN's earnings, revenue and cash flow is a great place to start, if you want to investigate the stock further.\n\nA Different Perspective\n\nWhile the broader market gained around 17% in the last year, ASGN shareholders lost 44%. However, keep in mind that even the best stocks will sometimes underperform the market over a twelve month period. Unfortunately, last year's performance may indicate unresolved challenges, given that it was worse than the annualised loss of 5% over the last half decade. We realise that Baron Rothschild has said investors should \"buy when there is blood on the streets\", but we caution that investors should first be sure they are buying a high quality business. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important. For instance, we've identified  1 warning sign for ASGN that you should be aware of.\n\nOf course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking elsewhere.

            "content": "What Happened?\n\nA number of stocks jumped in the afternoon session after the major indices rebounded, as Fed Chair Jerome Powell delivered dovish remarks at the much-awaited Jackson Hole symposium. Powell suggested that with inflation risks moderating and unemployment remaining low, the Federal Reserve might consider a shift in its monetary policy stance, including potential interest rate cuts. This outlook eased market concerns about prolonged high interest rates and their impact on economic growth. The prospect of lower borrowing costs bolstered investor confidence, particularly in sectors that have lagged, leading to a broad rally across the market.\n\nThe stock market overreacts to news, and big price drops can present good opportunities to buy high-quality stocks.\n\nAmong others, the following stocks were impacted:\n\nResearch Tools & Consumables company Bio-Techne (NASDAQ:TECH) jumped 5.8%.

Access our full analysis report here, it’s free.\n\nZooming In On 10x Genomics (TXG)\n\n10x Genomics’s shares are extremely volatile and have had 47 moves greater than 5% over the last year. In that context, today’s move indicates the market considers this news meaningful but not something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business.\n\nThe previous big move we wrote about was 1 day ago when the stock dropped 3.1% on the news that markets continued to decline, as investors grew cautious ahead of a key speech by Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. The move came as U.S. equity markets recorded a fifth consecutive day of losses for major indexes like the S&P 500, with technology stocks experiencing the largest declines. Investors have grown wary that the sharp rally in the tech sector since April may have advanced too far. The market-wide caution is largely driven by the upcoming Jackson Hole symposium, a meeting of central bankers, where traders are anxiously awaiting Fed Chair Powell's speech on Friday for guidance on the future path of interest rates.\n\nStory Continues\n\n10x Genomics is down 0.2% since the beginning of the year, and at $14.16 per share, it is trading 39.7% below its 52-week high of $23.49 from August 2024. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of 10x Genomics’s shares 5 years ago would now be looking at an investment worth $133.75.\n\nToday’s young investors likely haven’t read the timeless lessons in Gorilla Game: Picking Winners In High Technology because it was written more than 20 years ago when Microsoft and Apple were first establishing their supremacy. But if we apply the same principles, then enterprise software stocks leveraging their own generative AI capabilities may well be the Gorillas of the future. So, in that spirit, we are excited to present our Special Free Report on a profitable, fast-growing enterprise software stock that is already riding the automation wave and looking to catch the generative AI next.\n\nView Comments",

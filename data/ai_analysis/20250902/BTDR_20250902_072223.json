            "content": "It's been nearly a fortnight since Bitcoin hit the all-time high (ATH) of $124,457.12 on Aug. 14. Most crypto experts believe that the cryptocurrency is yet to achieve its full potential and have offered extremely bullish price predictions so far.\n\nWhether it's the crypto index fund manager Bitwise’s CIO Matt Hougan or the Bitcoin mining firm Bitdeer's (Nasdaq: BTDR) Head of Capital Markets and Strategic Initiatives Jeff LaBerge, each expert thinks Bitcoin will hit $200,000 in 2025. It doesn't seem like a herculean task for BTC, given the fact that it has surged 80% within a year.\n\nHowever, not everyone seems to be in agreement.\n\n$200K target 'extremely difficult'\n\nIt will be \"extremely difficult\" for Bitcoin to reach anything close to $200,000 this year, the analysts at 10x Research wrote in a report on Aug. 26.\n\nMore on Bitcoin:\n\nIf you bought Bitcoin instead of every new iPhone, you’d have $250M Trump firing Lisa Cook fuels Bitcoin ‘exit door’ narrative Cantor Fitzgerald analyst says Trump's grip on Fed is bullish for Bitcoin\n\nThe analysts said the gap between expectations and insights from data is widening, and the following factors are in play:\n\nFund inflows are declining.\n\nBitcoin miners are under pressure.\n\nSeasonal patterns are resurfacing just as traders turn complacent.Source: Glassnode, 10x Research\n\n54% chance of Bitcoin hitting $140K\n\nIt is obvious that 10x Research analysts are not as bullish as other prominent analysts on Bitcoin. However, they estimated that Bitcoin hitting $140,000 by the end of the year also carries only a 54% probability.\n\nThough the above target is only 12% lower than the king coin's record high and 25% lower than its current price, the analysts at 10x Research aren't bullish.\n\n\"Although we briefly engaged with the breakout attempt in mid-August, our Bitcoin trend model has since turned bearish.\"\n\nLaunched in 2009, Bitcoin is the world's largest cryptocurrency, which has a market cap of $2.23 trillion, even surpassing that of the tech giant Meta Platforms (Nasdaq: META).\n\nDisclaimer: The content above is intended for informational purposes only and should not be taken as financial advice.

            "content": "Bitdeer Technologies Group recently reported its second quarter 2025 earnings, revealing sales of US$155.58 million, up from US$99.23 million a year earlier, but a much larger net loss of US$147.73 million. While sales increased sharply, the widening net loss highlights ongoing financial pressures despite higher revenue in the latest results. We'll assess how the significantly higher net loss in Q2 reshapes Bitdeer Technologies Group's investment narrative and outlook.\n\nFind companies with promising cash flow potential yet trading below their fair value.\n\nBitdeer Technologies Group Investment Narrative Recap\n\nTo be a Bitdeer Technologies Group shareholder, you need to believe in its ability to leverage proprietary ASIC technology and operational integration to capture growth in both Bitcoin mining and ASIC hardware sales, even through swings in revenue and profitability. The latest Q2 2025 news, which shows a substantial rise in sales but a sharply higher net loss, places renewed focus on the biggest short-term catalyst, commercial ramp-up of ASICs, and raises fresh concerns about Bitdeer's ability to manage costs and sustain positive earnings momentum. While revenue growth remains a positive signal, the magnitude of the net loss could temper optimism for an imminent turnaround.\n\nAmong recent company updates, Bitdeer’s announcement that it self-mined 282 Bitcoins in June 2025, a 39% year-over-year increase thanks to the energization of SEALMINERs, closely relates to its prospects. This operational achievement directly supports revenue growth potential and showcases tangible progress on key technology investments, tying back to catalysts around efficiency and capacity gains highlighted by the company.\n\nYet, in contrast, investors should be aware that surging operating expenses and persistent net losses could...\n\nRead the full narrative on Bitdeer Technologies Group (it's free!)\n\nBitdeer Technologies Group's narrative projects $1.7 billion revenue and $196.5 million earnings by 2028.

            "title": "Bitcoin Miner Bitdeer Aims to Expand US Rig Manufacturing Amid Trump Tariff Headwinds",
            "content": "Bitcoin mining has faced challenging times as costs rise, rewards fall and the macroeconomic environment grows more uncertain, but Nasdaq-listed Bitdeer (BTDR) told Decrypt that it will focus on expansion in the months ahead.\n\nThe firm plans to build rigs and invest in U.S. resources, Bitdeer CFA Jeff LaBerge told Decrypt, even as its profits have slimmed. LaBerge said that U.S. President Donald Trump's favorable cryptocurrency policies may help the firm even as his trade policies hurt its ability to acquire mining equipment.\n\n\"It's created more things to think about,\" LaBerge said of President Trump's approach, but added that \"the policies have been supportive of crypto and energy\" on the whole.\n\n\"On the tariffs side, we're confident that we'll come to a Bitcoin-friendly resolution that will allow companies like ours to grow,\" he said.\n\nLaBerge's comments followed the release of the Singapore-based company's second quarter earnings reflecting at least some of the same impact faced by miners throughout the industry, even as Bitcoin’s price has jumped.\n\nBitdeer increased revenue to $155.6 million, beating analysts' estimates by more than 90% and higher than the $70.1 million for its 2024 first quarter. But it posted a net loss of $147.7 million compared to a net profit of $409.5 million for its first quarter.\n\nBitdeer's (BTDR) stock closed down by 0.3% on Wednesday to trade at $12.87. BTDR shares are off more than 43% year-to-date.\n\nBitdeer's now hoping manufacturing mining rigs—due to start this year for U.S. customers—will help the firm, along with its self-mining business. Many of its competitors are similarly planning to shift production to the U.S.\n\nIn a statement, Matt Kong, chief business officer at Bitdeer, said he expected the firm's financial results would \"improve sequentially.\"\n\nBitcoin was recently trading at $114,581, up 1.2% over the past 24 hours, but well off its most recently high of $124,128, set earlier this month.\n\nMiners, which are typically large industrial operations of specialized computers processing transactions and minting new coins for the cryptocurrency's network, have faced increasing headwinds over the past year. Bitcoin network difficulty now stands at a record high of 129 trillion. That's a 6.4% increase over the past 90 days, according to mining data provider CoinWarz.\n\nMeanwhile, transaction fees have slipped below 1% of block rewards for the first time ever. The revenue earned by miners comes from the static block reward, which is currently 3.125 BTC per block mined, and transaction fees paid by users. Before last year’s halving the payoff for miners stood at 6.25 Bitcoin.\n\nStory continues\n\nAmid these trends, a number of miners have moved resources to capture surging interest in artificial intelligence technology or refocused entirely to become cryptocurrency treasuries. BitMine Immersion now holds about $6.6 billion in Ethereum, while Bit Digital's treasury totals more than $520 million.\n\nBitdeer said that it did not have plans to reposition itself, even as its own Bitcoin holdings have grown.\n\n\"We're more practical than idealistic about holding Bitcoin on our balance sheet—it's not part of our identity, we're not looking to be seen as a Bitcoin treasury necessarily,\" LaBerge said.\n\nView comments",

GuruFocus has detected 5 Warning Signs with BTDR.\n\nRelease Date: August 18, 2025\n\nFor the complete transcript of the earnings call, please refer to the full earnings call transcript.\n\nPositive Points\n\nBitdeer Technologies Group (NASDAQ:BTDR) reported a significant increase in total revenue, reaching $155.6 million in Q2 2025, up 122% sequentially from Q1 and 57% year over year. The company achieved a substantial growth in self-mining hash rate, increasing by 162% from the beginning of the year to 22.3 exahash by the end of July. Bitdeer Technologies Group (NASDAQ:BTDR) successfully sold and shipped 5.3 exahash of its steel miner A2 mining rigs to external customers, generating $69.5 million in revenue. The company is on track to achieve its target of 40 exahash of self-mining hash rate by the end of October 2025, with expectations to exceed this target by year-end. Bitdeer Technologies Group (NASDAQ:BTDR) has made significant progress in its R&D efforts, with the development of the CLO4 chip, which is expected to set a new standard for Bitcoin mining efficiency.\n\nNegative Points\n\nDespite the revenue growth, Bitdeer Technologies Group (NASDAQ:BTDR) reported a negative IFRS net income of $147.5 million for Q2 2025. The company's gross margin decreased year over year, primarily due to the April 2024 halving event's impact on self-mining and higher mining difficulty. Bitdeer Technologies Group (NASDAQ:BTDR) experienced a decline in cloud hash rate revenue, which was $0 in Q2 2025 compared to $12.2 million in Q2 2024. The company faced higher operating expenses, totaling $42.3 million in Q2 2025, driven by increased R&D costs and general administrative expenses. Bitdeer Technologies Group (NASDAQ:BTDR) reported a net cash outflow from operating activities of $334.9 million, primarily due to payments for seal miner wafers and related production costs.\n\nStory Continues\n\nQ & A Highlights\n\nQ: Can you provide details on the data center opportunity at the Clarington site and whether similar opportunities exist at other sites like Rockdale and Norway? A: The focus is currently on the Clarington site, with minimal capital requirements expected from Bitdeer, as the partner and construction loans will provide funding. There are also inbound requests for Norway and Rockdale, but discussions are less advanced compared to Clarington. (Haris Basit, Chief Strategy Officer)\n\nQ: How is Bitdeer managing the balance between self-mining and external sales of mining rigs, especially with the new A3 chip? A: Bitdeer is prioritizing internal use to avoid idle capacity and capitalize on high self-mining margins. As internal capacity fills up, there will be a transition to more external sales. Long-term, the goal is to be a major vendor in the market. (Haris Basit, Chief Strategy Officer)\n\nQ: What is the outlook for ASIC prices and how does the A3 chip compare to competitors in terms of pricing? A: Pricing for the A3 chip has not been set yet, but it will be higher than the A2 due to its efficiency. The company aims to remain competitive in pricing, though the initial focus is on internal use rather than external sales. (Haris Basit, Chief Strategy Officer)\n\nQ: What is the strategy for using Bitcoin on the company's balance sheet, and how does it align with Bitdeer's financial goals? A: Bitdeer follows a balanced approach, selling some Bitcoin to maintain a healthy balance sheet while holding some for long-term value appreciation. The strategy is to ensure financial stability while capitalizing on Bitcoin's potential growth. (Jihan Wu, Chairman and CEO)\n\nQ: Can you provide more information on the advanced negotiations for the Clarington site and the potential for the A4 chip's application beyond Bitcoin mining? A: Advanced negotiations involve final legal documents and due diligence, with an announcement expected soon. The A4 chip, particularly the new technology version, may have applications in energy-intensive digital computing, though adoption for non-Bitcoin uses is a few years away.

            "content": "Many investors pay attention to mid-cap stocks because they have established business models and expansive market opportunities. However, their paths to becoming $100 billion corporations are ripe with competition, ranging from giants with vast resources to agile upstarts eager to disrupt the status quo.\n\nLuckily for you, our mission at StockStory is to help you make money and avoid losses by sorting the winners from the losers. That said, here is one mid-cap stock with a long growth runway and two best left ignored.\n\nTwo Mid-Cap Stocks to Sell:\n\nConstellation Brands (STZ)\n\nMarket Cap: $28.54 billion\n\nWith a presence in more than 100 countries, Constellation Brands (NYSE:STZ) is a globally renowned producer and marketer of beer, wine, and spirits.\n\nWhy Is STZ Not Exciting?\n\nOrganic revenue growth fell short of our benchmarks over the past two years and implies it may need to improve its products, pricing, or go-to-market strategy Projected sales decline of 6.9% for the next 12 months points to a tough demand environment ahead Expenses have increased as a percentage of revenue over the last year as its operating margin fell by 31.8 percentage points\n\nConstellation Brands is trading at $161.85 per share, or 12.6x forward P/E. If you’re considering STZ for your portfolio, see our FREE research report to learn more.\n\nKratos (KTOS)\n\nMarket Cap: $11.11 billion\n\nEstablished with a commitment to supporting national security, Kratos (NASDAQ:KTOS) is a provider of advanced engineering, technology, and security solutions tailored for critical national security applications.\n\nWhy Are We Hesitant About KTOS?\n\nFree cash flow margin dropped by 6.7 percentage points over the last five years, implying the company became more capital intensive as competition picked up Low returns on capital reflect management’s struggle to allocate funds effectively, and its shrinking returns suggest its past profit sources are losing steam Waning returns on capital from an already weak starting point displays the inefficacy of management’s past and current investment decisions\n\nAt $66.50 per share, Kratos trades at 112.6x forward P/E. Read our free research report to see why you should think twice about including KTOS in your portfolio, it’s free.\n\nOne Mid-Cap Stock to Buy:\n\nMr. Cooper Group (COOP)\n\nMarket Cap: $12.06 billion\n\nBorn from the 2018 merger of Nationstar Mortgage and WMIH Corp, Mr. Cooper Group (NASDAQ:COOP) is a non-bank servicer of residential mortgage loans that collects payments, manages escrow funds, and performs loss mitigation activities for 4.6 million customers.\n\nStory Continues\n\nWhy Will COOP Beat the Market?\n\nImpressive 22.9% annual revenue growth over the last two years indicates it’s winning market share this cycle Performance over the past two years was turbocharged by share buybacks, which enabled its earnings per share to grow faster than its revenue Notable projected tangible book value per share growth of 21.3% for the next 12 months hints at strong capital generation\n\nMr. Cooper Group’s stock price of $187 implies a valuation ratio of 2.2x forward P/B. Is now a good time to buy? See for yourself in our full research report, it’s free.\n\nStocks We Like Even More\n\nDonald Trump’s April 2025 \"Liberation Day\" tariffs sent markets into a tailspin, but stocks have since rebounded strongly, proving that knee-jerk reactions often create the best buying opportunities.\n\nThe smart money is already positioning for the next leg up.

            "content": "What Happened?\n\nShares of mortgage servicing company Mr. Cooper Group (NASDAQ:COOP) jumped 3.1% in the morning session after analysts reaffirmed their positive outlook on the company.\n\nThe mortgage servicing and origination provider's stock rose following reports of a strong consensus rating from Wall Street. According to an aggregation of 10 analysts covering the stock, Mr. Cooper Group holds a \"Buy\" consensus rating. This type of rating indicates that, on average, financial analysts believe the stock is a good investment and is expected to outperform the broader market. For investors, a strong buy consensus can signal confidence in the company's financial health, growth prospects, and overall business strategy, contributing to positive market sentiment.\n\nAfter the initial pop the shares cooled down to $191.72, down 0.7% from previous close.\n\nIs now the time to buy Mr. Cooper Group? Access our full analysis report here, it’s free.\n\nWhat Is The Market Telling Us\n\nMr. Cooper Group’s shares are quite volatile and have had 17 moves greater than 5% over the last year. In that context, today’s move indicates the market considers this news meaningful but not something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business.\n\nThe previous big move we wrote about was 5 days ago when the stock gained 8% on the news that the major indices rebounded, as Fed Chair Jerome Powell delivered dovish remarks at the much-awaited Jackson Hole symposium.\n\nPowell suggested that with inflation risks moderating and unemployment remaining low, the Federal Reserve might consider a shift in its monetary policy stance, including potential interest rate cuts. This outlook eased market concerns about prolonged high interest rates and their impact on economic growth. The prospect of lower borrowing costs bolstered investor confidence, particularly in sectors that have lagged, leading to a broad rally across the market.\n\nMr. Cooper Group is up 104% since the beginning of the year, and at $191.72 per share, it is trading close to its 52-week high of $202.86 from August 2025. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of Mr. Cooper Group’s shares 5 years ago would now be looking at an investment worth $10,704.\n\nUnless you’ve been living under a rock, it should be obvious by now that generative AI is going to have a huge impact on how large corporations do business. While Nvidia and AMD are trading close to all-time highs, we prefer a lesser-known (but still profitable) semiconductor stock benefiting from the rise of AI.

These ''units'' can be traded back and forth just like stocks, but can also be created or destroyed to accommodate investor demand.  Each week we monitor the week-over-week change in shares outstanding data, to keep a lookout for those ETFs experiencing notable inflows (many new units created) or outflows (many old units destroyed).  Creation of new units will mean the underlying holdings of the ETF need to be purchased, while destruction of units involves selling underlying holdings, so large flows can also impact the individual components held within ETFs.\n\nClick here to find out which 9 other ETFs experienced notable outflows »</p>\n\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.",

            "content": "What Happened?\n\nA number of stocks jumped in the afternoon session after the major indices rebounded, as Fed Chair Jerome Powell delivered dovish remarks at the much-awaited Jackson Hole symposium.

This outlook eased market concerns about prolonged high interest rates and their impact on economic growth.

But moves this big are rare even for Opendoor and indicate this news significantly impacted the market’s perception of the business.\n\nThe previous big move we wrote about was 2 days ago when the stock dropped 8.5% on the news that the major indices continued to pull back, with technology stocks accounting for most of the market's largest decliners.\n\nA key reason for this trend is that much of the recent market gains were concentrated in the \"AI trade,\" which includes these large technology and semiconductor companies. So this could also mean that some investors are locking in some gains ahead of more definitive feedback from the Fed. Despite the downturn, some analysts viewed this as an opportunity to own some of the \"Core AI winners.\" Dan Ives of Wedbush Securities commented, \"In our view, the tech bull cycle will be well intact for at least another 2-3 years, given the trillions being spent on AI infrastructure/software/chips/power/apps looking ahead. This remains our tech playbook and investor roadmap.\" Additionally, mixed earnings reports from retailers, such as Target, have added to the market's weakness. Investors are closely monitoring these reports for insights into the broader economic health and the potential impact of new tariffs on inflation.\n\nStory Continues\n\nOpendoor is up 189% since the beginning of the year, and at $4.60 per share, has set a new 52-week high. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of Opendoor’s shares 5 years ago would now be looking at an investment worth $418.82.\n\nUnless you’ve been living under a rock, it should be obvious by now that generative AI is going to have a huge impact on how large corporations do business.

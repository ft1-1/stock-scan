            "title": "August jobs report due out as Fed uncertainty looms: What to watch this week",
            "content": "The week ahead will bring US investors just four days of trading and a crucial jobs report, the first since July's dramatic revisions and the abrupt change at the top of the Bureau of Labor Statistics surprised investors.\n\nThe August jobs report's importance for investors is downstream of its importance for the Federal Reserve. Who will be serving on the Federal Reserve's Board of Governors by the end of the week ahead is far from certain.\n\nLast week, President Trump sought to remove Fed governor Lisa Cook from the central bank's board of governors. Cook challenged the decision, and a hearing on Friday left the decision in legal limbo. A Senate hearing for Trump's nominee to fill a temporary vacancy on the board is also set for the coming week.\n\nOutside of the monthly jobs report, labor market data will be a focus this week, with reports on job openings and a reading on private payroll growth from ADP set for release on Wednesday and Thursday, respectively.\n\nKey readings on the manufacturing and services sectors will also round out a busy economic calendar. On the earnings side, results from Dow member Salesforce (CRM), Broadcom (AVGO), Lululemon (LULU), DocuSign (DOCU), and Macy's (M) will feature as we enter the lull between the second and third quarter earnings seasons. Figma (FIG) will also provide its first report since going public.\n\nStocks finished last week little-changed, with optimism over the US economy pushing stocks to record highs on Thursday, while a modest disappointment on inflation data sent stocks lower on the week's final trading day.\n\nStill, the major indexes capped off their fourth straight winning month, with the S&P 500 (^GSPC) notching its first close above 6,500 on Thursday, as markets turn the page to the final month of the third quarter of 2025.\n\nChecking an 'unusual' labor market\n\nThe US labor market showed signs of a slowdown in July.\n\nThat was only the beginning of what's been a dramatic month for the normally staid world of economic policy.\n\nIn July, the US economy added 73,000 jobs, while revisions for May and June saw over 250,000 previously reported job gains wiped away. Following this report, President Trump removed Erika McEntarfer as commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n\nThe US economy is expected to have created 73,000 new jobs in the month of August, and the unemployment rate is forecast to rise to 4.3%.\n\nRead more: How jobs, inflation, and the Fed are all related\n\nIn a key policy speech at the Jackson Hole Economic Symposium on Aug. 22, Fed Chair Jerome Powell signaled that the central bank is likely to begin lowering interest rates at its policy meeting in September, pointing to a \"curious\" US labor market.\n\nStory Continues\n\n\"While the labor market appears to be in balance, it is a curious kind of balance that results from a marked slowing in both the supply of and demand for workers,\" Powell said.\n\n\"This unusual situation suggests that downside risks to employment are rising,\" he added. \"And if those risks materialize, they can do so quickly in the form of sharply higher layoffs and rising unemployment.\"Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell holds a document during a tour of the Federal Reserve Board building, which is currently undergoing renovations, in Washington, D.C., U.S., July 24, 2025. REUTERS/Kent Nishimura·REUTERS / Reuters\n\nQuestions over the health of the US labor market appear to have pushed Powell toward backing a rate cut from the central bank, a move that had already been supported by two of his colleagues on the FOMC — a contingent that is set to grow this week too.\n\nThe Senate Banking Committee is scheduled to hold a nomination hearing on Thursday for Stephen Miran, Trump's nominee to replace Adriana Kugler, who stepped down from the Fed board on Aug. 8. Should Miran get through the Senate as expected, yet another voice likely to support more aggressive rate cuts will be in the room when the Fed's next policy meeting kicks off on Sept. 16.\n\nWhether Fed governor Lisa Cook will also be in attendance remains less clear.\n\nCook sued President Trump this week after the president removed her from the Fed board due to alleged mortgage fraud. At a court hearing on Friday, the judge declined to make a ruling.\n\nThe legal drama surrounding Cook, Trump, and the Fed isn't expected to have a near-term impact on where interest rates are headed this year. That answer still remains \"lower.\"\n\nBut as Mohamed El-Erian argued in an op-ed for Yahoo Finance earlier this week, the cracks in the foundation of the central bank's independence are starting to show.\n\nIt's still a 'Magnificent' market\n\nWith second quarter earnings season just about wrapped up — some 98% of S&P 500 companies have already reported results — we can say this remains a market dominated by the \"Magnificent Seven\" tech giants: Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), Meta (META), Microsoft (MSFT), Nvidia (NVDA), and Tesla (TSLA).\n\nData from FactSet's John Butters published Friday showed earnings growth for the Magnificent Seven names during the second quarter came in at 26.6%, well outpacing the 8.1% annual earnings growth realized by the other 493 members of the index so far.\n\nRead more: Live coverage of corporate earnings\n\nMeta, Microsoft, Amazon, and Nvidia's earnings were four of the top six contributors to the index's earnings growth during the quarter.\n\nOnly Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX), which reported net income that flipped from a loss of $3.6 billion a year ago to a gain of $1.03 billion in the latest quarter, and Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD), which reported net income of $1.6 billion against a loss of nearly $10 billion a year ago, broke up what would've been a clean sweep for the Big Tech leaders.\n\nIn his report on Friday, Butters noted that analysts expect earnings growth for the Magnificent Seven names to slow in the coming quarters. For the rest of the S&P 500, earnings growth is expected to reaccelerate in the first part of 2026.\n\nBoth data points help explain why the stock market's rally has been so durable since the mid-April bottom.\n\nOn April 9, Trump took the worst-case scenario for tariffs off the table. An easy case for why stocks should go up.\n\nBut the fundamental backdrop for both the stock market's highest-profile names and the jumble of less flashy companies that make up the rest of the S&P 500 has also improved.\n\nOver the long run, nothing matters more to stock prices than earnings growth.\n\nOver the short run, nothing matters more to stock prices than the rate of change of that growth.\n\nWhen the second quarter earnings season began, investors were looking for the second quarter to mark a sharp slowdown from the first. By the time the second quarter earnings season started to wrap up, that slowdown was more modest.\n\nBetween June 30 and Friday's close, the S&P 500 rose 5%.\n\nSNP - Delayed Quote•USD\n\n(^GSPC)\n\nFollow  View Quote Details\n\n6,460.26\n\n-41.60\n\n(-0.64%)\n\nAt close: August 29 at 5:35:52 PM EDT  ^GSPC^IXIC ^DJI\n\nAdvanced Chart\n\nEconomic and earnings calendar\n\nMonday\n\nEconomic data: US markets closed for Labor Day.\n\nEarnings calendar: US markets closed for Labor Day.\n\nTuesday\n\nEconomic data: S&P Global US manufacturing PMI, August final reading (53.3 previously); ISM manufacturing PMI (48.9 expected, 48 previously)\n\nEarnings calendar: Zscaler (ZS), Nebius Group (NBIS), NIO (NIO)\n\nWednesday\n\nEconomic data: MBA mortgage applications, week ending Aug. 29 (-0.5% previously); JOLTS job openings (7.23 million expected, 7.4 million previously); Factory orders, July (-1.4% expected, -4.8% previously); Wards total vehicle sales, August (16 million annualized expected, 16.41 million previously); Federal Reserve releases Beige Book\n\nEarnings calendar: Salesforce (CRM), Figma (FIG), Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company (HPE), Dollar Tree (DLTR), The Campbell's Company (CPB), Macy's (M), C3.ai (AI), American Eagle Outfitters (AEO)\n\nThursday\n\nEconomic data: ADP private payrolls, August (+70,000 expected, +104,000 previously); Initial jobless claims, week ending Aug. 29 (228,000 expected, 229,000 previously); Trade balance (-$62.6 billion expected, -$60.2 billion previously); ISM services PMI, August (50.5 expected, 50.1 previously); S&P Global US services PMI, August final reading (50.5 expected, 50.1 previously)\n\nEarnings calendar: Broadcom (AVGO), Copart (CPRT), Lululemon (LULU), DocuSign (DOCU)\n\nFriday\n\nEconomic data: Nonfarm payrolls, August (+75,000 expected, +73,000 previously); Unemployment rate, August (4.3% expected, 4.2% previously); Average hourly earnings, month-on-month, August (+0.3% expected, +0.3% previously); Average hourly earnings, year-on-year, August (+3.8% expected, +3.9% previously)\n\nEarnings calendar: ABM Industries (ABM)StockStory aims to help individual investors beat the market.\n\nClick here for in-depth analysis of the latest stock market news and events moving stock prices\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance\n\nView Comments",

            "content": "Second quarter earnings season is coming to a close, and with nearly all of the reports in, the results have been mostly positive.\n\nAs of Aug. 29, 98% of S&P 500 index companies have reported results, according to FactSet data, and analysts now expect S&P 500 companies to report an 11.9% jump in earnings per share during the second quarter.\n\nCompanies had lower expectations to clear coming into the quarter — analysts expected S&P 500 earnings to rise 5% in Q2, the slowest pace of earnings growth since Q4 2023 — amid President Trump's tariffs, stocks' lofty valuations, and uncertainty about the health of the US economy.\n\nIn the wings next week will be updates from Zscaler (ZS), Nebius Group (NBIS), NIO (NIO), Salesforce (CRM), Figma (FIG), Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company (HPE), Dollar Tree (DLTR), The Campbell's Company (CPB), Macy's (M), C3.ai (AI), American Eagle Outfitters (AEO), Broadcom (AVGO), Copart (CPRT), lululemon (LULU), DocuSign (DOCU), and ABM Industries (ABM).\n\nMeanwhile, investors will continue to mull over recent reports, in particular Nvidia's (NVDA) earnings, which highlighted the week. The $4 trillion company's stock fell 2% for the week after investors weighed a miss in data center revenue with what CEO Jensen Huang said was \"extraordinary\" demand for Blackwell chips.\n\nOther companies reported too, including PDD Holdings (PDD), Alibaba (BABA), Okta (OKTA), Abercrombie & Fitch (ANF), CrowdStrike (CRWD), Five Below (FIVE), HP (HP), Kohl's (KSS), Snowflake (SNOW), J.M. Smucker (SJM), Urban Outfitters (URBN), Affirm (AFRM), Best Buy (BBY), Bath & Body Works (BBWI), Dick's Sporting Goods (DKS), Dell (DELL), Dollar General (DG), Gap (GAP), Petco (WOOF), Wolfspeed (WOLF), Bank of Montreal (BMO), MongoDB (MDB), and Ulta (ULTA).\n\nHere are the latest updates from corporate America.LIVE310 updates\n\nFeatured\n\nToday at 10:24 AM UTC\n\nJenny McCall\n\nAlibaba's AI revenue climbs even as China food war hurts profit\n\nReuters reports:\n\nRead more here.\n\nToday at 12:23 PM UTC\n\nGrace O'Donnell\n\nUlta Beauty shines after annual forecast hike on steady demand, UK expansion\n\nUlta Beauty (ULTA) gained 3% in premarket trading after the beauty retailer raised its annual sales and profit forecast on Thursday.

The stock fell 4% in early trading on Thursday.\n\nFor the year, same-store sales are expected to be in a range of down 1% to up 1%. Revenue is forecast to be in the range of $41.1 billion to $41.9 billion, while adjusted earnings per share are guided to be between $6.15 and $6.30.\n\n\"The low end of the range would certainly say we're giving lots of room for a consumer to potentially be more impacted by tariffs,\" CEO Corie Barry said on a call with media, \"but the reason we're pointing to the high end is we don't see evidence that that is going to happen.\"\n\nWall Street expects revenue of $41.36 billion and adjusted earnings of $6.14 for the full fiscal year, per Bloomberg consensus estimates.\n\nBarry said the company plans to lean into promotions this holiday season to ensure it's driving demand for consumers, who have been seeking value for the last year and a half.\n\nRead more here.

It delivered adjusted earnings of $0.94, more than the forecasted $0.69.\n\n\"This unprecedented start to the year is largely a result of a long-term focus on monetizing Build-A-Bear's unique position in the marketplace, multi-generational appeal and exceptional brand recognition to scale the business with innovative initiatives across three strategic pillars,\" CEO and President Sharon Price John told investors on its earnings call.\n\nThe company also raised its 2025 fiscal-year guidance.\n\n\"When considering these results were achieved in a wide variety of economic challenges and geopolitical shifts, they serve as a valuable source of confidence in our team, our brand, our plans and the company's future,\" Price John told investors, \"With that in mind, while we understand a meaningful portion of the year remains and acknowledge the potential for some economic uncertainty ahead, we also believe it is appropriate to increase our 2025 guidance at this juncture.\"\n\nIt now expects revenue to grow on a mid-to-high single-digit basis, up from the previously expected mid-single-digit increase.\n\nIt also plans to open more locations, now in the range of at least 50 to 60.

These offsets, together with our Q1 earnings favorability, provide a path to achieving our original guidance.”\n\nBurlington's Q2 results were better than expected. The retailer reported earnings per share of $1.47 on $2.7 billion in revenue. Wall Street expected earnings of $1.25 per share on revenue of $2.6 billion, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence.

Now I’ll hand over to Stephen to go through our outlook, guidance and our new shareholder return plan. Thank you, Siti. As we look ahead for fiscal year twenty six, we remain optimistic and committed to not only driving revenue growth, but also placing greater emphasis on upholding profitability across all business lines, supported by various cost control and efficiency enhancements measures. To better reflect our long term strategic priorities and align with the nature of the education industry, characterized by longer business cycles with seasonality.\n\nWe are now providing full year guidance in addition to our quarterly outlook. We believe this standard guidance offers more meaningful and accurate reflection of our business performance and strategy as it smooths out short term seasonal volatility. We encourage investors to focus on this long term indicator, which provides a clearer and more comprehensive view of our business, operational progress, and growth trajectory. We expect total net revenue for the group, including Easter buy in the first quarter of fiscal year 02/1926, 06/01/2025 to 08/31/2025 to be in the range of to be in the range of $1,464,100,000 to $1,507,200,000, representing a year over year increase in the range of 2% to 5%. As for the total net revenue of the pool, also including Easter buy for the full year 2026 06/01/2025 to 05/31/2026, we expect to be in the range of $5,145,300,000 to $5,390,300,000, representing a year over year increase in the range of 5% to 10%.\n\nYou may notice that our fiscal year twenty six q one guidance looks relatively conservative. This is primarily because the group has now entered a more stable and sustainable phase, and we are comparing against the high base of the last year q one. Unlike two years ago, when we were still undergoing major transformation. Moreover, Easter by restructuring have not yet taken place in fiscal year twenty five q one either. Additionally, the earlier timing of the Chinese New Year this year led to temporary class rescheduling, which boosted the revenue recognition in 2025, but will reduce revenue recognition in fiscal year twenty six q one.\n\nAs a result, we expect the year over year revenue growth will accelerate since the second quarter and throughout the rest of the year. Hence, as I mentioned earlier, I would encourage all of you to focus on our annual guidance. Before ending this quarter’s earnings summary, I would like to announce that the board approved the three year shareholder return plan yesterday, effective from fiscal year two thousand twenty six as a gesture of appreciation for our shareholders unwavering support. Under this plan, no less than 50% of the company’s net income attributable to New Oriental for the preceding fiscal year will be allocated to returning value to shareholder through dividend distributions and or share repurchase. For fiscal year twenty six for for for for for fiscal year twenty twenty six, the board will determine the implementation of the plan based on the net income attributed to New Oriental for the fiscal year ended in 05/31/2025 in due course.\n\nNow to conclude, New Oriental remain committed to delivering premium offerings for our customer who are pursuing sustainable growth and profitability and sharing the fruits of our success with our shareholders. We’re also in close collaboration with the government authorities in various province and and and province in China, issuing compliance with the relevant policies, guidelines, and the the related implementation, and adjusting our business operation as required. This is the end of our fiscal year 02/2004 summary. At this point, I would like to open the floor for questions. Operator, please open the call for this.\n\nThank you.\n\nConference Operator:  Thank you. The question and answer session of this conference call will start in a moment. In order to be fair to all callers who wish to ask a question, we will take one question at a time from each caller. If you have more than one question, please request to rejoin the queue again after your first question has been addressed. To ask a question, please press star Just a moment for our first question.\n\nFirst question comes from the line of Felix Liu from UBS. Your line is now open.\n\nStephen Young, Executive President and Chief Financial Officer, New Oriental:  Good evening. Thank you, management, for taking my question. My question is on your q one and the f one twenty six guidance. We noticed that Q4, the new rental core business actually grew pretty fast. But then as you mentioned, there was a seasonal slowdown in Q1.\n\nSo may I just ask for more break down of your Q1 as well as full year guidance? What are the drags on the business that led to this slowdown? And the main concern about the drivers for the recovery in growth in after Q1? Thank you. Okay.\n\nThank you, Felix. Yeah. The as for the q one guidance, yeah, and there’s a whole year guidance of fiscal year twenty six. You know, in the coming q one, we we give the guidance of the the revenue growth will be in the range of 2% to 5%. I must mention, firstly, that we’re using the conservative method to give the guidance.\n\nAnd there there were some some following reasons. Number one, to some extent, I think our business adversely affects by the economic environment and the international relation changes. So in the coming q one, we we are comparing the the against the high base last year of q one. Both of the core educational business and the East of us. And number two, you know, as for the k 12 business, we have some the cutoff issue.\n\nBecause, you know, in this this year’s Chinese New New Year was earlier than than before. So that means, you know, some that means, you know, the in the second half of fiscal ’25, we had more revenue. And the results is that the in the coming q one, we have less revenue. So this is a cutoff issue. And and and but, you know, as we expect the k twelve revenue growth will be accelerate in the coming q two and the rest of the year in q three and q four.\n\nBecause based on our current estimation of this the forecast for the for the whole year and the cash will collect already for the q two courses. So that’s why that has that’s why we expect the revenue acceleration since q two for the k twelve business. And and the the last reason is, you know, last year q one, Easter buy restructuring has not yet taken place in q one. So we have we will have a hard comparison for Easter buy in in the coming Q1. But in the since q two, it will be better.\n\nAnd, yeah, this time, it it seems this quarter, we start to give the the whole year’s guidance. We do the guidance of the 5% to 10% year over year growth for the for the whole group. And it shows that the the revenue growth acceleration since q two. And breakdown of the the the different business lines. I think the overseas related business, yeah, it will negatively impact by the economic environment and international situations change.\n\nSo we expect the revenue will be down by roughly four or 5%. And the k 12 business, I think the k nine business for the q one, the revenue growth will be somewhere around 16% year over year. But we do expect the whole year revenue growth for k nine business will be somewhere around 20%. High school business, q one and the whole year will be around year over year growth will be around 11 to 12% or even a little bit more. And the college business, the growth rate will be 10% in the q one and the coming new year.\n\nThank you. Have a nice day.\n\nConference Operator:  Thank you. Just a moment for our next question, please. Next, we have Lucy Yu from Bank of America. Your line is now open, Lucy.\n\nCece Gao, Investor Relations, New Oriental:  I think I have actually\n\nConference Operator:  a follow-up question on the guidance that\n\nCece Gao, Investor Relations, New Oriental:  you just gave. What is the latest that you have been revised this quarter versus last quarter when you took the guidance for FY ’26? So what has changed in terms of line of business? And secondly, just to clarify on the first, the shareholder return program, is it based on reported net income or non GAAP net income? Thank you.\n\nStephen Young, Executive President and Chief Financial Officer, New Oriental:  Second question, answer first. You know, the capital allocation for the next three years is calculated based on the net income. The net income as we go to GAAP net income as we go to NewRampo. And I think yeah. This time, we changed the guidance from the the nine used to buy to the whole group, yeah, including the used to buy.\n\nBecause, you know, used to buy started to to restructure restructure the business since last year q one. So in the past in past of four, two to a quarter, I think the management of the Easter buy fixed the the operation. And, you know, Easter buy still, we will control the buy. So I think it’s a good time for us to give the guidance of the whole group including the the Easter buy. And I I think going forward, we will give the guidance for the whole group including the Easter buy.\n\nWe’ll see.\n\nLucy Yu, Analyst, Bank of America:  Thank you, Steven. One more follow-up.\n\nCece Gao, Investor Relations, New Oriental:  So the all of guidance revenue growth is all in US dollar or renminbi?\n\nStephen Young, Executive President and Chief Financial Officer, New Oriental:  Dollars. In dollars. And you are using current rate? Yeah. We we’re yeah.\n\nWe’re using the the current the current the exchange rate in the first the the forty five, fifty days of this quarter.\n\nLucy Yu, Analyst, Bank of America:  Okay. Thank you so much.\n\nStephen Young, Executive President and Chief Financial Officer, New Oriental:  Thank you, Lucy.\n\nConference Operator:  Thank you. Next, we have Yuchen Jung from Citi. Your line is now open.\n\nStephen Young, Executive President and Chief Financial Officer, New Oriental:  Hello. Good evening, Steven and sister. Thank you for taking my question. My question is about the acceleration of our revenue. So what is the main reason for our revenue deceleration, especially for the nonaccept nonaccepting business?\n\nSo is it because of the competition or it’s just our own adjustment? And if we, like, look in our long term, like, in the next few years, how do we think of our growth rate in next few years? Thank you. I think the revenue is slowing down. It’s mainly due to the the the economic environment and the international relationship change.\n\nBecause, you know, we have seen some transparents, you know, some of them doesn’t want to send their kids to study abroad in the future. So it will negatively impact our the overseas business. And as for the competition, the k 12 field, I think, yeah, the competition is little bit stronger than that of last year. But I think it’s okay, You know? If you compare the competition level now with those a couple of years ago, you know, before the policy, it’s much it’s much less.\n\nAnd so the I think, you know, the market is is still huge, especially for the k nine, not dynamic courses of the the business. So we feel that the the k nine business grow by 10% in the coming of year. I think, you know, during this macro economic situation, I think it’s it’s still good. And going forward and the yeah. The q one is a little bit weak.\n\nBut the yeah. Based on our current estimate, I think the q q two and q three q four will be better. And in the longer term, I do think the k twelve business will be the key growth driver of the whole group. Yes. Can I have a follow-up question, sir?\n\nBecause if we if we look at the revenue growth before the policy, maybe our k k 12 revenue growth rate can be over 20%. But but for now, maybe it’s just, like, around 15%. So if you look at the next few years, would the growth rate for k twelve business, like, going up to the over 20% or or just around, like, 10 to 20%? I think the k nine business is you know, we don’t believe we can get the revenue growth by 20%, you know. It it it it still be very good.\n\nAnd and the the high school business, because we we got the all time high in last fiscal year, so we have a high base. So going forward, I think the the revenue growth will be somewhere around 10 to 15% going forward. Okay. Thank you.\n\nConference Operator:  Thank you. Just a moment for our next question, please. Next, we have Alice Chou from bank Citibank. Your line is now open, Alice.\n\nLucy Yu, Analyst, Bank of America:  Good evening, Steven. Have two questions. And first one is on the margin trend. Mhmm. How should we think about the operating margin trend for the FY ’26?\n\nFor the core education business and also the whole business. Because since that we started to provide guidance for the whole business. Right? And my second question is on the goodwill impairment. And can you please give us some more color on this?\n\nWhy is there was there a good goodwill associated with kindergarten between two to three weeks? And will the company continue to die back or feel that non non core business and also, like, cultural tourism? Thanks.\n\nStephen Young, Executive President and Chief Financial Officer, New Oriental:  Okay. Thank you, Alex. You know, you are a margin question. You know, let us start with the this quarter’s margin analysis. You know, in in the in the q four in this quarter, we we we got the four hundred four hundred and ten basis for the margin expansion.\n\nI think the margin expansion, even for the q four and the whole year, fiscal year twenty five, was mainly due to the operating leverage and the the efficiency headset and the cost control. As you know, we started to do the cost control since March, and we have seen the good results, which helps to drive the margin up. And I do believe the cost control will help the margin profile in the coming year, even the q one and the whole year, fiscal year twenty six. As we look at the margin of the q one, we remain optimistic about the the margin profile in q one, even though we’re facing some revenue slowing down, but we still expect the margin expansion in the coming q one. And the whole year margin, I think it’s a little bit early to make a forecast of the New Year margin.\n\nAnd but, you know, we’re doing the cost control. We care more. We focus more about the profitability than the revenue growth. And so I think we will strive to achieve the margin, you know, profile, the healthy margin profile in the in the whole year of the fiscal year twenty six. And so let me summarize.\n\nYou know, when we are slowly slowing down and we care more about the the bottom line, and we will do more cost control and care more about the efficiency enhancement and the more operating leverage to drive the margin up in the coming quarter and the new year. K. So your second question is about the who will department of the kindergarten. Oh, you know, we we acquired the some kindergarten so many years ago. This is roughly 18 years old.\n\nAnd, you know, be careful with some reasons, the policy and the the new the new boards, you know, decrypt. So I think we discussed with the the auditors, and I you know, we think the goodwill impairment should be done at this time. So we we did the impairment loss of $60,000,000 in this quarter, but it’s all. It’s one time.\n\nLucy Yu, Analyst, Bank of America:  Yes. May I have a follow-up question? Would like to know more about this culture assurance. Is there any plans to steal back the business? Right?\n\nWhat was that?\n\nStephen Young, Executive President and Chief Financial Officer, New Oriental:  Can you repeat again? Can you repeat it?\n\nLucy Yu, Analyst, Bank of America:  Is there any yes. Is there anything to build back the cultural tourism?\n\nStephen Young, Executive President and Chief Financial Officer, New Oriental:  Tourism business. Oh, tourism business. Yeah. We started with the the tourism business one and a half years ago. And the the revenue growth in last fiscal year, fiscal ’25, was, you know, extremely high.\n\nAnd, you know, most of the rest most of the business, the tourism business are, you know, relate to the summer camp study tour, both domestic and and and internationally. And but going forward, I think the we still need time to build the business model of the tourism. And I think the revenue growth of the tourism just will be slowed down in the in the new year. And, anyway, it’s a new business. We need more time to to to fix the bid business model of the chosen business.\n\nK? Thank you.\n\nLucy Yu, Analyst, Bank of America:  Okay.\n\nConference Operator:  Thank you. Just a moment for our next question, please. Next, we have Timothy Zhao from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.\n\nTimothy Zhao, Analyst, Goldman Sachs:  Sure. Thank you, Steven, for taking my question. I think my question is regarding the profitability and margin outlook. I think one is regarding the 4.1 percentage point margin increase for the core business for the past quarter. Just wondering if you can help quantify the impact on the cost control measures that you have done since March.\n\nAnd going forward into the new year, like how much room that you have for cost control? And secondly, also on the modern related question on the capacity expansion. Just wondering, I think, the May, how many new learning centers were newly opened? And what is your learning center or the capacity expansion plan into fiscal year Thank you.\n\nStephen Young, Executive President and Chief Financial Officer, New Oriental:  The the margins yeah. Yeah. The q four, we we got the the margin expansion by four hundred four hundred and ten basis point up. And it’s really hard for us to to justify how much from the cost control. But it’s a anyway, that’s a good result, the cost control, and the the to speak to the high operating leverage.\n\nAnd going forward, even in the q one coming q one and the new year, I think the cost control will help us to drive the margin up. And and roughly, it’s the cost control will give us the the, let’s say, the one one hundred to 150 basis points might be up. So this is the roughly estimation. And your second question is about the extension. Right?\n\nYeah. Yeah. This thing I think the in the q four, the net add is 9%. It’s eight to 9% in learning centers. And and going forward, in the coming New Year, I think our our our plan is to monitor the capacity expansion to ensure alignment of revenue growth.\n\nSo I think as the whole group, we will control the learning center expansion compared to the revenue growth. So we do hope we can have the leverage from the high utilization rate of the new learning centers. So roughly, we originally, we plan to open 10 to 15% of the new learning center. It it depends on the revenue growth. And the and, you know, typically, we set up new learning centers, new learning new learning centers in second half of the year.\n\nSo it’s, you know, back loaded. And so I think we have one or two quarters to wait to decide how many learning centers we set up in the second half of the year to prepare for the new year. And so and I must mention that we only allow the cities with the best with the better top end growth and mark good margins to allow them to open the learning centers, especially for the kids’ offices. Yeah. Tim, thank you.\n\nThank you, Steven.\n\nConference Operator:  Thank you. Just a reminder, please make sure to ask one question. And if you have more questions, please re queue. Next, we have Diaz Kim from JPMorgan. Your line is now open.\n\nStephen Young, Executive President and Chief Financial Officer, New Oriental:  Hi. Thank you. Thanks, Steven and Sister, for taking my question. I just have a few follow ups from the previous comment, if that’s okay. So you earlier mentioned the margin could go up in the first order.\n\nWere you referring to the group level or for educational need? That’s the first follow-up to all your point. And second, can I just double check when you say a quick control can give us about, like, hundred hundred fifth 50 bps of margin expansion? Is it regarding first quarter or full year? Just as a follow-up.\n\nAnd I have one more question. For the full year, the cost control. And, you know yeah. I I said we because we we we start we we we go back to give the guidance for whole group. So the margin not as guidance is for the group.\n\nSo what I’m saying is the whole group’s margin expansion will be happened in q one. Got it. Thank you. And, again, this is kind of follow-up, but I did a very rough calculation based on the numbers that you gave us to break down. And I think we are essentially guiding core education, East Pie, to grow about 11%, 12% in fiscal twenty six versus, I think, last quarter, you mentioned 15% growth.\n\nAm I right about this? Or can you comment on education on your apples to apples guidance versus last quarter? Just want to double check. The the full year ’26. Right?\n\nOr ’26. Yes, sir. ’26, sir. Yeah. It it seems to be a little bit lower than, you know, we we get the guidance, you know, last quarter.\n\nBecause, you know yeah. As I said, the overdue related business, you know, where we I think, you know, it will next to the impact by the micro economy and the the the the international relationship change. And so we revised the guidance of the fiscal year ’26. I think the overseas revenue business will be down by, let’s say, the 5% four or 5% year over year. This is for the whole year.\n\nSo this is the a a new change compared to the Got it. Yeah. Thank thank you. So I I think that’s probably in place 12% if you have the number. If not, that’s totally fine.\n\nAnd final question is in terms of the buyback and dividend, can you give us a little bit of color on how you are thinking about between the two? Like, is it is it it gonna be depend on the level of your prices? Or do you have certain, you know, pockets within that 50% in mind for dividend at least this much? Any sort of a qualitative color would be appreciated, and that’s it. Thank you, sir.\n\nI think, you know, first of all, we finished $700,000,000 share buyback in this quarter in in q four. And also, we we paid $100,000,000 special dividend in last year, in this fiscal year last year last year of September. And so, you know, we had a board meeting yesterday. And, you know, I have I’m happy to see the board approve the new capital allocation program, not only for this year, but also for next three years from fiscal year twenty six to fiscal year twenty eight. So which amounted to the, let’s say, the 50% of the net debt, net income.\n\nAnd now, you know, we haven’t yet decide the the dividend or the share buyback. I think I will discuss with the board, even Michael, to to make a decision to to to justify either the dividend or share buyback or both. But, you know, one more information. I think we still need the the auditors to to give us the final Audi report of the fiscal year twenty five. And I think we will file the the twenty eighth.\n\nThe at the end at the end of roughly, at the September. So by then, I think we will decide, you know, how much amount to do the capital allocation and waste. Yeah. Thank you. And if I just make a comment, another question, I I think many or most investors may prefer, you know, dividend rather than buyback because dividend seems a little more feasible and sustainable.\n\nSo please please consider, you know and especially if it is a regular dividend, not in the form of special that we did pre pre pre COVID. So just a few cents from me, and thank you so much for your call. Okay. Thank you, dear. Thank you.\n\nYou’re very welcome. You.\n\nConference Operator:  Thank you. Just a moment for our next question, please. Next, we have Charlotte Wei from HSBC. Your line is now open. Thank you,\n\nLucy Yu, Analyst, Bank of America:  Steven and Suzu for taking my question. I have a question regarding the non academic enrollment. So we I noticed that this quarter’s enrollment growth slowed down quite meaningfully. Can I understand can can could you please provide some color on the reasons? And also, can you share with us the summer enrollment growth for the k nine non academic tutoring?\n\nAnd how does it compare to the industry growth trend? Thank you.\n\nStephen Young, Executive President and Chief Financial Officer, New Oriental:  Yeah. As I said, you know, there is some seasonality impact. Yeah. As I said, you know, because of the early Chinese New Year and, you know, some revenues were reported in in in q three and q four last year. And so it will likely see impact to the q one revenue enrollment.\n\nAnd, yeah, q one is a it’s low, you know, it’s it seems to be low. But I think, you know, based on our the numbers, the cash and the student enrollment, we have already got from from customers for the q two courses. I think the numbers are just higher than the q one. So that’s why, as I said, we expect the revenue growth will be accelerate in the q two since q two. And that’s why we we gave the guidance of a whole year higher than the q one.\n\nAnd the industry growth sorry. Sorry. I have no idea about the whole industry growth, and it it’s really hard for for me to make a comparison between us and the other competitors. And yeah.\n\nLucy Yu, Analyst, Bank of America:  Thank you.\n\nConference Operator:  Thank you. Just a more questions. Thank you.\n\nStephen Young, Executive President and Chief Financial Officer, New Oriental:  K. Thank you.\n\nConference Operator:  Thank you. Just a moment for our next question. Next, we have Alicia Chen from CLSA. Your line is now open.\n\nLucy Yu, Analyst, Bank of America:  Hi. Thank you, Steven and sister. So my question is about the summer. So we we we are now in the summer, so I would like to see if you have any color on the summer student recruitment. For example, like, the new student enrollment growth and also, like, retention rate.\n\nAnd do you observe any changes on the demand side? Thank you.\n\nStephen Young, Executive President and Chief Financial Officer, New Oriental:  The demand, it’s a little less than we expected, you know, compared to one quarter ago. Yeah. Because of the the whole the economic situation. And but, you know, the but but it’s not right, but but I I think it’s still good, you know, for the k twelve business, even for the industry. And I don’t believe the whole industry is still well.\n\nAnd I think we are very few taking the market share. And and yeah. As of that, I don’t think for q two, the revenue growth will be accelerated again. And so yeah. And the the enrollment number in the summer.\n\nWe we we have we haven’t finished the enrollment window for the summer. So I think next next quarter’s earnings call, I will share with the number. Show you the number. Enrollment for the whole time.\n\nLucy Yu, Analyst, Bank of America:  Okay. Thank you. And about the retention rate?\n\nStephen Young, Executive President and Chief Financial Officer, New Oriental:  The retention is still going up. Hopefully, the the the whole the k nine business and high school business is still going up.\n\nLucy Yu, Analyst, Bank of America:  Okay. Got it. Thank you.\n\nStephen Young, Executive President and Chief Financial Officer, New Oriental:  Thank you.\n\nConference Operator:  Thank you. We are now approaching the end of the conference call. I will now turn the call over to New Oriental’s executive president and CFO, Stephanie Young, for his closing remarks.\n\nStephen Young, Executive President and Chief Financial Officer, New Oriental:  Again, thank you for joining us today. If you have any further questions, please do not hesitate to contact me or any of our investor relations representative. Thank you.\n\nConference Operator:  This concludes today’s conference call.

            "title": "Institutional owners may consider drastic measures as New Oriental Education &amp; Technology Group Inc.'s (NYSE:EDU) recent US$332m drop adds to long-term losses",
            "content": "Key Insights\n\nSignificantly high institutional ownership implies New Oriental Education & Technology Group's stock price is sensitive to their trading actions A total of 8 investors have a majority stake in the company with 52% ownership 12% of New Oriental Education & Technology Group is held by insiders\n\nTrump has pledged to \"unleash\" American oil and gas and these 15 US stocks have developments that are poised to benefit.\n\nA look at the shareholders of New Oriental Education & Technology Group Inc. (NYSE:EDU) can tell us which group is most powerful. And the group that holds the biggest piece of the pie are institutions with 60% ownership. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.\n\nAs a result, institutional investors endured the highest losses last week after market cap fell by US$332m. The recent loss, which adds to a one-year loss of 25% for stockholders, may not sit well with this group of investors. Often called “market movers\", institutions wield significant power in influencing the price dynamics of any stock. As a result, if the downtrend continues, institutions may face pressures to sell New Oriental Education & Technology Group, which might have negative implications on individual investors.\n\nLet's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about New Oriental Education & Technology Group.\n\nView our latest analysis for New Oriental Education & Technology Group NYSE:EDU Ownership Breakdown August 3rd 2025\n\nWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About New Oriental Education & Technology Group?\n\nInstitutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.\n\nWe can see that New Oriental Education & Technology Group does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of New Oriental Education & Technology Group, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too.NYSE:EDU Earnings and Revenue Growth August 3rd 2025\n\nSince institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. Our data indicates that hedge funds own 8.3% of New Oriental Education & Technology Group. That worth noting, since hedge funds are often quite active investors, who may try to influence management. Many want to see value creation (and a higher share price) in the short term or medium term. From our data, we infer that the largest shareholder is Minhong Yu (who also holds the title of Top Key Executive) with 12% of shares outstanding. Its usually considered a good sign when insiders own a significant number of shares in the company, and in this case, we're glad to see a company insider play the role of a key stakeholder. With 8.3% and 7.8% of the shares outstanding respectively, First Beijing Investment Ltd. and Norges Bank Investment Management are the second and third largest shareholders.\n\nStory Continues\n\nOn further inspection, we found that more than half the company's shares are owned by the top 8 shareholders, suggesting that the interests of the larger shareholders are balanced out to an extent by the smaller ones.\n\nWhile studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.\n\nInsider Ownership Of New Oriental Education & Technology Group\n\nWhile the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.\n\nMost consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.\n\nOur information suggests that insiders maintain a significant holding in New Oriental Education & Technology Group Inc.. Insiders own US$890m worth of shares in the US$7.3b company. That's quite meaningful. It is good to see this level of investment. You can check here to see if those insiders have been buying recently.\n\nGeneral Public Ownership\n\nThe general public-- including retail investors -- own 10% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.\n\nNext Steps:\n\nWhile it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important.\n\nI like to dive deeper into how a company has performed in the past. You can find historic revenue and earnings in this detailed graph.\n\nIf you would prefer discover what analysts are predicting in terms of future growth, do not miss this freereport on analyst forecasts.\n\nNB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.

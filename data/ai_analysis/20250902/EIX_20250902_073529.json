This move underscores the balance Edison International must strike between rewarding shareholders and preserving financial flexibility as it manages its debt load and responds to evolving regulatory and wildfire risk factors.\n\nHowever, investors should be mindful that, in contrast to the steady dividend flow, the threat of further wildfire liabilities remains a significant issue that could ...\n\nRead the full narrative on Edison International (it's free!)\n\nEdison International's narrative projects $20.6 billion revenue and $2.6 billion earnings by 2028.

            "content": "Edison International (NYSE:EIX) ranks among the best stocks to buy for retirement. UBS retained its Buy rating for Edison International (NYSE:EIX), with a price target of $68 on August 20. According to UBS analyst Gregg Orrill, while the proposed ruling in Edison’s rate case permits the rate base as expected, debates and comments filed indicate possible financing gaps that, if not addressed, might lead to underinvestment.\n\nOn the other hand, UBS noted a number of potential drivers for Edison International (NYSE:EIX), including a potential settlement for the Woolsey disaster and the enactment of wildfire regulations, which the firm described as “Wildfire Fund Clarity a Potential Positive.”\n\nAccording to UBS, the stock is currently prices in a $2 billion equity issuance at 9x the company’s 2027 estimated earnings per share of $6.47. The firm also noted that Edison International (NYSE:EIX) indicated during its second-quarter earnings call that it might wait a few weeks after the rate case decision before providing guidance.\n\nBased in California, Edison International (NYSE:EIX) is a public utility company that specializes at generating power from a variety of sources, including renewable energy, nuclear energy, and natural gas.\n\nWhile we acknowledge the potential of EIX as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.

Noting the stock is down 31% since the January California fires, a caller asked Cramer whether it is a buy. In response, he said:\n\n“Yeah, I am going to have to punt on that. You know, look, I just think California’s too hard. I just really do. I think it’s too hard. Even for Patti Poppe, it’s too hard. If it’s too hard for Patti Poppe, it’s too hard for me. Now, she wouldn’t say it’s too hard, but I think it’s too hard, and I don’t want to, look, you know, I think it’s a little higher risk.”\n\nA stock market chart. Photo by Arturo A on Pexels\n\nEdison International (NYSE:EIX) produces and delivers electricity throughout Southern California. The company serves residential, commercial, industrial, and agricultural customers. The stock was among the worst performers in the S&P 500 in the first half of 2025 and Cramer stated on July 1:\n\n“Finally, the fifth worst performer… of the first half was Edison International, that’s a regulated electric utility in southern California, with the stock that was down 35%. This year began with those horrific LA wildfires, which took place in the company’s service area. But that’s not what truly crushed the stock. California utilities have all proven to be bad investments this year… What’s the issue in California?

            "content": "On August 28, 2025, Edison International and Southern California Edison announced preferred dividends, reinforcing their shareholder commitment. Over the past month, Edison International's stock rose 4%, aligning with the broader market's positive trend and the market's 2% increase over the last 7 days. The company also reported on July 31, a mixed earnings report with an increase in net income for the first half of the year but a decline in quarterly net income. Meanwhile, market uncertainty regarding tech stocks did not seem to significantly impact EIX's stock, maintaining its upward trajectory with broader market gains.\n\nEvery company has risks, and we've spotted 3 warning signs for Edison International (of which 1 is potentially serious!) you should know about.EIX Earnings Per Share Growth as at Aug 2025\n\nThese 13 companies survived and thrived after COVID and have the right ingredients to survive Trump's tariffs. Discover why before your portfolio feels the trade war pinch.\n\nEdison International's recent announcement of preferred dividends is indicative of its commitment to enhancing shareholder value, aligning with its strategy amid electrification trends and grid modernization efforts. Over the past month, Edison International's shares increased 4%, supported by these strategic initiatives. However, before looking at these recent movements, it's important to note that the company's total return, inclusive of share price and dividends, was 29.83% over the past five years. This long-term performance provides a broader context, underscoring the company's steady growth in a complex regulatory and environmental landscape.\n\nWhen placed against the short-term performance of the US market and Electric Utilities industry, Edison International's one-year returns have fallen short, highlighting an area for potential improvement. Despite this, the company's focus on policy-driven electrification and decarbonization initiatives could bolster revenue and earnings projections. Analysts forecast revenue growth to continue at an annual rate of 5.6% over the next three years, although profit margins might shrink from 15% to 12.4%. The recent dividend announcement may positively influence investor sentiment and potentially lead to further stock price appreciation, narrowing the current gap to the consensus price target of US$66.23. At present, the stock trades at US$54.72, indicating a 21% potential upside according to analyst expectations. Investors are advised to assess whether the company's mitigative actions against climate-related risks can sustain long-term revenue and earnings momentum.\n\nLa historia continúa\n\nUnlock comprehensive insights into our analysis of Edison International stock in this financial health report.\n\nThis article by Simply Wall St is general in nature.

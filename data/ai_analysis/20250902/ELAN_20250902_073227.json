            "title": "ELAN Crosses Above Average Analyst Target",
            "content": "In recent trading, shares of Elanco Animal Health Inc (Symbol: ELAN) have crossed above the average analyst 12-month target price of $15.85, changing hands for $15.90/share.  When a stock reaches the target an analyst has set, the analyst logically has two ways to react: downgrade on valuation, or, re-adjust their target price to a higher level.  Analyst reaction may also depend on the fundamental business developments that may be responsible for driving the stock price higher — if things are looking up for the company, perhaps it is time for that target price to be raised.\n\nThere are 10 different analyst targets within the Zacks coverage universe contributing to that average for Elanco Animal Health Inc, but the average is just that — a mathematical average.  There are analysts with lower targets than the average, including one looking for a price of $12.00.  And then on the other side of the spectrum one analyst has a target as high as $20.00.  The standard deviation is $2.625.\n\nBut the whole reason to look at the average ELAN price target in the first place is to tap into a \"wisdom of crowds\" effort, putting together the contributions of all the individual minds who contributed to the ultimate number, as opposed to what just one particular expert believes.  And so with ELAN crossing above that average target price of $15.85/share, investors in ELAN have been given a good signal to spend fresh time assessing the company and deciding for themselves: is $15.85 just one stop on the way to an even higher target, or has the valuation gotten stretched to the point where it is time to think about taking some chips off the table?  Below is a table showing the current thinking of the analysts that cover Elanco Animal Health Inc:  Recent ELAN Analyst Ratings Breakdown»Current1 Month Ago2 Month Ago3 Month AgoStrong buy ratings:6533Buy ratings:1100Hold ratings:3455Sell ratings:0000Strong sell ratings:1111Average rating:1.952.142.562.56\n\nThe average rating presented in the last row of the above table above is from 1 to 5 where 1 is Strong Buy and 5 is Strong Sell.

            "content": "The S&P 500 Index ($SPX) (SPY) on Wednesday closed up by +0.24%, the Dow Jones Industrials Index ($DOWI) (DIA) closed up by +0.32%, and the Nasdaq 100 Index ($IUXX) (QQQ) closed up by +0.17%.  September E-mini S&P futures (ESU25) rose +0.20%, and September E-mini Nasdaq futures (NQU25) rose +0.13%.\n\nStock indexes recovered from early losses on Wednesday and settled higher, with the S&P 500 posting a new record high and the Nasdaq 100 reaching a one-week high.  Strength in software stocks led the overall market higher as MongoDB surged more than +37% after reporting better-than-expected Q2 adjusted EPS and raising its 2026 adjusted EPS forecast.

boosted stocks.  Over the last five years, Nvidia has only missed on earnings in one quarter.  With a $4.4 trillion market capitalization, Nvidia has an 8.1% weighting in the S&P 500, giving it significant power to impact the index.\n\nStocks extended their gains Wednesday afternoon after bond yields gave up an early advance and turned lower on expectations that the Fed would cut interest rates as soon as next month.  The 10-year T-note yield fell -2 bp to 4.24%.\n\nComments today from New York Fed President Williams were neutral to slightly dovish, as he stated that the US economy is slowing, not stalling, and he remains optimistic about the economy's direction.  He added that every FOMC meeting is \"live\" for interest rates and that at some point, it will be appropriate for us to adjust rates downward as we remain in a \"modestly restrictive\" stance on policy.\n\nUS MBA mortgage applications fell -0.5% in the week ended August 22, with the purchase mortgage sub-index up +2.2% and the refinancing mortgage sub-index down -3.5%.  The average 30-year fixed rate mortgage rose +1 bp to 6.69% from 6.68% in the prior week.\n\nRegarding tariffs, President Trump late Monday threatened to impose new tariffs and export restrictions on advanced technology and semiconductors in retaliation against other nations' digital services taxes that hit American companies.  Last week, Mr. Trump widened steel and aluminum tariffs to include more than 400 consumer items that contain the metals, such as motorcycles, auto parts, furniture components, and tableware.  The change went into effect last Monday and did not exclude goods already in transit.\n\nIn other recent tariff news, Mr. Trump on August 13 extended the tariff truce with China for another 90 days until November.  On August 6, Mr. Trump announced that he will double tariffs on US imports from India to 50% from the current 25% tariff, due to India's purchases of Russian oil.  According to Bloomberg Economics, the average US tariff will rise to 15.2% if rates are implemented as announced, up from 13.3% earlier, and significantly higher than the 2.3% in 2024 before the tariffs were announced.\n\nThe markets this week will focus on any fresh tariff news or developments on ending the Ukraine-Russian war.  On Thursday, Q2 GDP is expected to be revised upward by +0.1 to 3.1% (q/q annualized).  Also, weekly initial unemployment claims are expected to fall by -5,000 to 230,000.  On Friday, July personal spending is expected to climb +0.3% m/m, and July personal income is expected to rise +0.4% m/m.   Also, the July core PCE price index, the Fed's preferred inflation gauge, is expected to climb +0.2% m/m and +2.9% y/y.  In addition, the Aug MNI Chicago PMI is expected to fall -0.6 to 46.5.  Finally, the University of Michigan's final-Aug US consumer sentiment index is expected to be unrevised at 58.6.\n\nFederal funds futures prices are discounting the chances for a -25 bp rate cut at 88% at the next FOMC meeting on September 16-17.  The markets are discounting the chances at 51% for a second -25 bp rate cut at the following meeting on October 28-29.\n\nEarnings reports indicate that S&P 500 earnings for Q2 are on track to rise +9.1% y/y, much better than the pre-season expectations of +2.8% y/y and the most in four years, according to Bloomberg Intelligence.  With Q2 earnings season winding down, over 95% of S&P 500 firms having reported Q2 earnings, about 82% of companies exceeded profit estimates.\n\nOverseas stock markets on Wednesday settled mixed.  The Euro Stoxx 50 rebounded from a 2-week low and closed up +0.17%.  China's Shanghai Composite closed down -1.76%.  Japan's Nikkei Stock 225 closed up +0.30%.\n\nInterest Rates\n\nSeptember 10-year T-notes (ZNU5) on Wednesday closed up +6.5 ticks, and the 10-year T-note yield fell -2.4 bp to 4.238%.\n\nT-notes recovered from early losses on Wednesday and rallied to a 1.5-week high, and the 10-year T-note yield fell to a 1.5-week low of 4.234%. Short covering emerged in T-notes to push prices higher after New York Fed President Williams said that at some point, it will be appropriate for us to move rates down, as we are still in a \"modestly restrictive\" stance on policy.\n\nT-notes initially moved lower on Wednesday due to rising inflation expectations, following the 10-year breakeven inflation expectations rate's rise to a 6-month high of 2.456%.  Weak demand for the Treasury's $70 billion auction of 5-year T-notes on Wednesday was also bearish for prices, as the auction had a bid-to-cover ratio of 2.36, below the 10-auction average of 2.38.  In addition, T-notes are under pressure due to President Trump's move to fire Fed Governor Cook, which exacerbates investor concerns about the Fed's independence and fuels inflation fears if politics forces interest rates below the neutral rate.\n\nEuropean government bond yields on Wednesday moved lower.  The 10-year German bund yield fell to a 1.5-week low of 2.686% and finished down -2.3 bp to 2.700%.  10-year UK gilt yield fell -0.5 bp to 4.736%.\n\nThe German Sep GfK consumer confidence survey unexpectedly fell -1.9 to a 5-month low of -23.6, weaker than expectations of no change at -21.5.\n\nSwaps are discounting the chances at 3% for a -25 bp rate cut by the ECB at the September 11 policy meeting.\n\nUS Stock Movers\n\nMongoDB (MDB) closed up more than +37% to lead software stocks higher after reporting Q2 adjusted EPS of $1.08, well above the consensus of 65 cents, and raising its 2026 adjusted EPS forecast to $3.64-$3.73 from a previous forecast of $2.94-$3.12, stronger than the consensus of $3.20.  Also, Atlassian (TEAM) closed up more than +4% to lead gainers in the Nasdaq 100, and Salesforce

tariff costs.\n\nPayPal Holdings (PYPL) closed down nearly 1% after the Suddeutsche Zeitung reported that several banks had blocked direct debits in the wake of payments that appeared to be suspicious

4.238%. \n\nT-notes recovered from early losses on Wednesday and rallied to a 1.5-week high, and the 10-year T-note yield fell to a 1.5-week low of 4.234%. Short covering emerged in T-notes to push prices higher after New York Fed President Williams said that at some point, it will be appropriate for us to move rates down, as we are still in a \"modestly restrictive\" stance on policy.\n\nT-notes initially moved lower on Wednesday due to rising inflation expectations, following the 10-year breakeven inflation expectations rate's rise to a 6-month high of 2.456%.  Weak demand for the Treasury's $70 billion auction of 5-year T-notes on Wednesday was also bearish for prices, as the auction had a bid-to-cover ratio of 2.36, below the 10-auction average of 2.38.  In addition, T-notes are under pressure due to President Trump's move to fire Fed Governor Cook, which exacerbates investor concerns about the Fed's independence and fuels inflation fears if politics forces interest rates below the neutral rate. \n\nEuropean government bond yields on Wednesday moved lower.  The 10-year German bund yield fell to a 1.5-week low of 2.686% and finished down -2.3 bp to 2.700%.  10-year UK gilt yield fell -0.5 bp to 4.736%.\n\nThe German Sep GfK consumer confidence survey unexpectedly fell -1.9 to a 5-month low of -23.6, weaker than expectations of no change at -21.5.\n\nSwaps are discounting the chances at 3% for a -25 bp rate cut by the ECB at the September 11 policy meeting.\n\nUS STOCK MOVERS\n\nMongoDB (MDB

            "content": "The S&P 500 Index ($SPX) (SPY) on Wednesday closed up by +0.24%, the Dow Jones Industrials Index ($DOWI) (DIA) closed up by +0.32%, and the Nasdaq 100 Index ($IUXX) (QQQ) closed up by +0.17%.  September E-mini S&P futures (ESU25) rose +0.20%, and September E-mini Nasdaq futures (NQU25) rose +0.13%.\n\nStock indexes recovered from early losses on Wednesday and settled higher, with the S&P 500 posting a new record high and the Nasdaq 100 reaching a one-week high.  Strength in software stocks led the overall market higher as MongoDB surged more than +37% after reporting better-than-expected Q2 adjusted EPS and raising its 2026 adjusted EPS forecast.\n\nMore News from Barchart\n\nDear Lucid Group Stock Fans, Mark Your Calendars for August 29 CEO Alex Karp Just Sold $60 Million in Palantir Stock. Should You Ditch PLTR Here Too? Options Traders Are Betting Nvidia Stock Will Move This Much After Earnings Markets move fast. Keep up by reading our FREE midday Barchart Brief newsletter for exclusive charts, analysis, and headlines.\n\nAlso, optimism that Nvidia will report stellar earnings results after Wednesday's close boosted stocks.  Over the last five years, Nvidia has only missed on earnings in one quarter.  With a $4.4 trillion market capitalization, Nvidia has an 8.1% weighting in the S&P 500, giving it significant power to impact the index.\n\nStocks extended their gains Wednesday afternoon after bond yields gave up an early advance and turned lower on expectations that the Fed would cut interest rates as soon as next month.  The 10-year T-note yield fell -2 bp to 4.24%.\n\nComments today from New York Fed President Williams were neutral to slightly dovish, as he stated that the US economy is slowing, not stalling, and he remains optimistic about the economy's direction.  He added that every FOMC meeting is \"live\" for interest rates and that at some point, it will be appropriate for us to adjust rates downward as we remain in a \"modestly restrictive\" stance on policy.\n\nUS MBA mortgage applications fell -0.5% in the week ended August 22, with the purchase mortgage sub-index up +2.2% and the refinancing mortgage sub-index down -3.5%.  The average 30-year fixed rate mortgage rose +1 bp to 6.69% from 6.68% in the prior week.\n\nRegarding tariffs, President Trump late Monday threatened to impose new tariffs and export restrictions on advanced technology and semiconductors in retaliation against other nations' digital services taxes that hit American companies.  Last week, Mr. Trump widened steel and aluminum tariffs to include more than 400 consumer items that contain the metals, such as motorcycles, auto parts, furniture components, and tableware.  The change went into effect last Monday and did not exclude goods already in transit.\n\nStory Continues\n\nIn other recent tariff news, Mr. Trump on August 13 extended the tariff truce with China for another 90 days until November.  On August 6, Mr. Trump announced that he will double tariffs on US imports from India to 50% from the current 25% tariff, due to India's purchases of Russian oil.  According to Bloomberg Economics, the average US tariff will rise to 15.2% if rates are implemented as announced, up from 13.3% earlier, and significantly higher than the 2.3% in 2024 before the tariffs were announced.\n\nThe markets this week will focus on any fresh tariff news or developments on ending the Ukraine-Russian war.  On Thursday, Q2 GDP is expected to be revised upward by +0.1 to 3.1% (q/q annualized).  Also, weekly initial unemployment claims are expected to fall by -5,000 to 230,000.  On Friday, July personal spending is expected to climb +0.3% m/m, and July personal income is expected to rise +0.4% m/m.   Also, the July core PCE price index, the Fed's preferred inflation gauge, is expected to climb +0.2% m/m and +2.9% y/y.  In addition, the Aug MNI Chicago PMI is expected to fall -0.6 to 46.5.  Finally, the University of Michigan's final-Aug US consumer sentiment index is expected to be unrevised at 58.6.\n\nFederal funds futures prices are discounting the chances for a -25 bp rate cut at 88% at the next FOMC meeting on September 16-17.  The markets are discounting the chances at 51% for a second -25 bp rate cut at the following meeting on October 28-29.\n\nEarnings reports indicate that S&P 500 earnings for Q2 are on track to rise +9.1% y/y, much better than the pre-season expectations of +2.8% y/y and the most in four years, according to Bloomberg Intelligence.  With Q2 earnings season winding down, over 95% of S&P 500 firms having reported Q2 earnings, about 82% of companies exceeded profit estimates.\n\nOverseas stock markets on Wednesday settled mixed.  The Euro Stoxx 50 rebounded from a 2-week low and closed up +0.17%.  China's Shanghai Composite closed down -1.76%.  Japan's Nikkei Stock 225 closed up +0.30%.\n\nInterest

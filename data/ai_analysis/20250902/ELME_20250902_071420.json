            "content": "This story was originally published on Multifamily Dive. To receive daily news and insights, subscribe to our free daily Multifamily Dive newsletter.\n\nDive Brief:\n\nAfter initiating a “formal evaluation of strategic alternatives” earlier this year, Elme Communities took the first step to liquidating the company by selling a 19-asset portfolio to Atlanta-based investor, developer and manager Cortland Partners for $1.6 billion in cash, according to a news release. The deal is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2025. In conjunction with the sale, the Bethesda, Maryland-based REIT’s board of trustees has approved a plan of sale and liquidation under which the company would market its remaining nine multifamily assets, as well as Watergate 600 — an office asset — with the goal of a sale in the next 12 months. The REIT’s shareholders still need to approve the plan. Elme has received a debt commitment of $520 million from Goldman Sachs Bank USA to provide debt financing secured by the REIT’s assets not included in the Cortland sale. The availability of the loan is contingent upon closing on all 19 properties.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nOver the past several years, Elme, formerly known as WashREIT until 2022, has expanded its presence outside the Washington, D.C., metro area by acquiring properties in Atlanta, an effort to diversify its portfolio. Still, its stock continued to trade at a discount to values in the private market, forcing the REIT to explore alternatives.\n\n“Elme has made deliberate strategic decisions to advance and refine our portfolio with the goal of maximizing shareholder value,” said Paul McDermott, president and CEO of Elme, in the news release. “Following a thorough board-led process, and despite our successful transformation into a focused multifamily platform with strong operating capabilities, market conditions have not allowed us to lower our cost of capital in a way that supports accretive growth.”\n\nDuring the review process, Elme’s board consulted with more than 80 counterparties before determining that property sales were the most effective approach.\n\n“Our evaluation process was robust, underpinning the board’s unanimous determination that the combination of the sale of assets to Cortland and subsequent sale of the remaining assets is most likely to result in the greatest value for shareholders as compared to the company’s other strategic alternatives, including continuing to operate the business as an independent going concern,” Benjamin Butcher, lead independent trustee at Elme, said in the release.\n\nStory Continues\n\nAnthony Paolone, executive director at JPMorgan, estimated a 5.7% cap rate on the 19 properties sold to Cortland and a 6.4% cap rate on the remaining properties in a research note shared with Multifamily Dive.\n\n“Overall, while pricing wasn’t as strong as we hoped, we think that the Elme board and management ran a good process to try to maximize value,” Paolone wrote. “We think the realization that it was going to have a difficult time achieving an attractive cost of capital in the public markets and was better off taking the money today for shareholders deserves kudos.”\n\nPaolone also suggested that the Cortland deal may show that there isn’t as much liquidity in the multifamily sector as is often believed, even though the portfolio is skewed toward class B properties and centered in the Washington, D.C., area, where concerns exist about federal job cuts.\n\n“We no less think the point is clear that cap rates on larger transactions are higher than the ‘4s’ being cited for the best assets in the best locations in one-off trades,” Paolone wrote.\n\nCortland, the No. 9 apartment owner in the country, is no stranger to making deals with publicly traded REITs. In 2019, the firm became the largest apartment owner in the Dallas area after its $1.2 billion privatization of Canadian-based Pure Multifamily REIT.\n\n“This [Elme] transaction is a major milestone in Cortland’s history, as we significantly grow our presence in the greater Washington, D.C. area and our home state of Georgia,” said Steven DeFrancis, CEO of Cortland, in the release.\n\nClick here to sign up to receive multifamily and apartment news like this article in your inbox every weekday.\n\nRecommended Reading\n\nEQR to purchase 8 apartment properties for $535M\n\nView Comments",

            "title": "Modiv Industrial Announces Second Quarter 2025 Results",
            "content": "DENVER, August 07, 2025--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Modiv Industrial, Inc. (\"Modiv Industrial,\" \"Modiv\" or the \"Company\") (NYSE:MDV), the only public REIT exclusively focused on acquiring industrial manufacturing real estate, today announced operating results for the second quarter ended June 30, 2025.\n\nHighlights:\n\nSecond quarter 2025 revenue of $11.8 million and net loss attributable to common stockholders of $(2.8) million. Second quarter AFFO of $4.8 million, or $0.38 per diluted share, a 22% year-over year increase, beating consensus estimates. 5-year lease renewal with 2% annual escalations on our Northrop Grumman property located in Melbourne, Florida.\n\nThe following is a statement from Aaron Halfacre, CEO of Modiv Industrial.\n\n\"I don’t know about you but the second quarter of 2025 left me feeling a bit dizzy - like I spent too much time on a high speed merry-go-round. The sheer volume of events that happened over the quarter was mind-numbing. The bombing of Iran and the end of the Trump-Musk bromance feel like ancient history. Everyday seems to be a new sensational headline. Meanwhile, the Fed pissing match ensues, tariff speculation remains rampant, tech stocks and crypto continue to defy gravity, and the REIT sector seems stuck in a perpetual toilet swirl.\n\nYet, here at Modiv, it was calm, steady and decidedly non-dizzying. In fact, you might call this quarter flat out boring. We stuck to our discipline, worked our patience and tended to the details. No flash, no bang, needed to deliver the 22% year-over year increase in quarterly results.\n\nAlas, the past won’t make us any more money than it has, so let me share some thoughts on the future:\n\nLending Thaw - Though our term loan doesn’t mature until January 2027, we are a bit like Aesop’s Ant always preparing for a future winter and, as such, we’ve been speaking to the bank lending market and our takeaway is that lenders have shifted from reluctantly lending toward a somewhat more normal willingness to lend. Both debt refinancing and new acquisition financing seem available to those who seek it.\n\nHunting Wabbits - Market activity seems to confirm the thaw. Not only have there been a recent spat of large dollar single and multi-asset acquisitions by higher profile REITs, we have also seen numerous attractive note offerings. However, watching the big REITs do what they do isn’t nearly as telling of a potential pivot point as it is to watch the activity of the more diminutive real estate enterprises. Be it the number of strategic alternative review announcements (e.g. GIPR, PGRE, FSP, ELME), the take private of City Office REIT (NYSE: CIO), or the Kawa bid on Orion (NYSE: ONL), we are starting to see early signs that people are willing to place their bets. Of relevance, to a net lease company like Modiv, are the two recent net lease platform acquisitions: the first being the acquisition of Elm Tree Funds by BlackRock (NYSE: BLK) and the second being the acquisition of Fundamental Income by Starwood Trust (NYSE: STWD). Long duration WALT portfolios appear to be in vogue. As a small cap REIT with 14+ WALT and a healthy balance sheet, our head is always on swivel and I shared our thoughts on M&A earlier this year. We are cognizant that there is a food chain (and where we sit on it), but we are a fierce small mammal, more honey badger than rabbit, so it remains to be seen if we are the hunted or the hunter.\n\nStory Continues\n\nRecycling Green - With signs of tighter cap rates being observed in the acquisition markets and the numerous unsolicited overtures for our properties (and beyond), it is starting to feel like we might be entering the right stage to begin the next phase of our asset recycling program to generate even more greenbacks. Modiv has about $150 million of assets that we have long thought about recycling into more appropriate opportunities. Based on our deep analysis of the respective property markets, we believe these assets, if recycled as we intend, could produce at least 100 basis points of AFFO growth within 12+ months from a green light.\n\nDiscipline over Dopamine - As we all know, history tends to repeat itself. Different actors, different stage, same story. We have seen these capital markets in the past. We know that the disciplined investors thrive because they know to control their emotions and work their plan. If you haven’t noticed yet, MDV loves discipline.\n\nUntil next quarter.\n\nGrit, grind, get it done!\" Aaron Halfacre, CEO of Modiv Industrial.\n\nConference Call and Webcast\n\nA conference call and audio webcast with analysts and investors will be held on Thursday, August 7, 2025, at 11:00 a.m. Eastern Time / 8:00 a.m. Pacific Time, to discuss the second quarter ended June 30, 2025 operating results and answer questions.\n\nLive conference call: 1-800-717-1738 or 1-646-307-1865 at 11:00 a.m. Eastern Time, Thursday, August 7, 2025\n\nWebcast: To listen to the webcast, either live or archived, please use this link: https://viavid.webcasts.com/starthere.jsp?ei=1728161&tp_key=435cf678e4 or visit the investor relations page of Modiv’s website at www.modiv.com.\n\nAbout Modiv Industrial\n\nModiv Industrial, Inc. is an internally managed REIT that is focused on single-tenant net-lease industrial manufacturing real estate.

Class X OP Units were excluded from the weighted average shares/units outstanding in calculating earnings (loss) per share for the three and six months ended June 30, 2025 in the unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations since they were anti-dilutive.\n\nIn order to provide a more complete understanding of the operating performance of a REIT, the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (\"Nareit\") promulgated a measure known as Funds from Operations (\"FFO\"). FFO is defined as net income or loss computed in accordance with GAAP, excluding gains and losses from sales of depreciable operating property, plus real estate-related depreciation and amortization (excluding amortization of deferred financing costs and depreciation of non-real estate assets), and after adjustment for unconsolidated investments, preferred dividends and real estate impairments. Because FFO calculations adjust for such items as depreciation and amortization of real estate assets and gains and losses from sales of operating real estate assets (which can vary among owners of identical assets in similar conditions based on historical cost accounting and useful-life estimates), they facilitate comparisons of operating performance between periods and between other REITs. As a result, we believe that the use of FFO, together with the required GAAP presentations, provides a more complete understanding of our performance relative to our competitors and a more informed and appropriate basis on which to make decisions involving operating, financing, and investing activities. It should be noted, however, that other REITs may not define FFO in accordance with the current Nareit definition or may interpret the current Nareit definition differently than we do, making comparisons less meaningful.\n\nAdditionally, we use Adjusted Funds from Operations (\"AFFO\") as a non-GAAP financial measure to evaluate our operating performance. AFFO excludes non-routine and certain non-cash items such as stock-based compensation, amortization of deferred rent, amortization of below/above market lease intangibles, amortization of deferred financing costs, gain or loss from the extinguishment of debt, unrealized gains (losses) on derivative instruments, amortization of off-market interest rate derivatives and reduction for accrued interest, and write-offs of due diligence expenses for abandoned pursuits. We also believe that AFFO is a recognized measure of sustainable operating performance in the REIT industry. Further, we believe AFFO is useful in comparing the sustainability of our operating performance with the sustainability of the operating performance of other real estate companies. Management believes that AFFO is a beneficial indicator of our ongoing portfolio performance. More specifically, AFFO isolates the financial results of our operations. AFFO, however, is not considered an appropriate measure of historical earnings as it excludes certain significant costs that are otherwise included in reported earnings. Further, since the measure is based on historical financial information, AFFO for the period presented may not be indicative of future results. By providing FFO and AFFO, we present information that assists investors in aligning their analysis with management’s analysis of long-term operating activities.\n\nFor all of these reasons, we believe the non-GAAP measures of FFO and AFFO, in addition to income or loss from operations, net income or loss and cash flows from operating activities, as defined by GAAP, are helpful supplemental performance measures and useful to investors in evaluating the performance of our real estate portfolio. AFFO is useful in assisting management and investors in assessing our ongoing ability to generate cash flow from operations and continue as a going concern in future operating periods. However, a material limitation associated with FFO and AFFO is that they are not indicative of our cash available to fund distributions since other uses of cash, such as capital expenditures at our properties and principal payments of debt, are not deducted when calculating FFO and AFFO. Therefore, FFO and AFFO should not be viewed as a more prominent measure of performance than income or loss from operations, net income (loss) or cash flows from operating activities and each should be reviewed in connection with GAAP measurements.\n\nNeither the SEC, Nareit, nor any other applicable body has opined on the acceptability of the adjustments contemplated to adjust FFO in order to calculate AFFO and its use as a non-GAAP performance measure. In the future, the SEC or Nareit may decide to standardize the allowable exclusions across the REIT industry, and we may have to adjust the calculation and characterization of this non-GAAP measure.\n\nMODIV INDUSTRIAL, INC.\n\nReconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures - Adjusted EBITDA\n\n(in thousands)\n\n(Unaudited)  Three Months Ended June 30,  Six Months Ended June 30, 2025    2024    2025    2024  Net (loss) income (in accordance with GAAP)  $ (2,633 )  $ 1,262   $ (1,804 )  $ 5,899  Depreciation and amortization of real estate properties   3,828    4,137    7,646    8,270  Depreciation and amortization for unconsolidated investment in a real estate property   189    189    378    379  Interest expense, net of unrealized gain on interest rate swaps and derivative settlements   4,016    4,103    8,064    6,410  Interest expense for unconsolidated investment in real estate property   92    93    186    188  Impairment of real estate investment property   4,000    —    4,000    —  Stock compensation expense   810    67    1,294    1,446  Gain on sale of real estate investments, net   —    —    (84 )   (3,188 ) Loss on equity investments   —    5    —    26  Adjusted EBITDA  $ 10,302   $ 9,856   $ 19,680   $ 19,430   Annualized Adjusted EBITDA  $ 41,208   $ 39,424   $ 39,360   $ 38,860   Net debt:  Consolidated debt  $ 280,642   $ 281,083   $ 280,642   $ 281,083  Debt of unconsolidated investment in real estate property (1)   8,893    9,138    8,893    9,138  Consolidated cash and cash equivalents   (5,814 )   (18,870 )   (5,814 )   (18,870 ) Cash of unconsolidated investment in real estate property (1)   (607 )   (298 )   (607 )   (298 ) Net debt  $ 283,114   $ 271,053   $ 283,114   $ 271,053   Net debt / Adjusted EBITDA  6.9 x  6.9 x  7.2 x  7.0 x  (1) Reflects the Company's 72.71% pro rata share of the tenant-in-common's mortgage note payable and cash.\n\nWe define Net Debt as gross debt less cash and cash equivalents. We define Adjusted EBITDA as GAAP net income or loss adjusted to exclude real estate related depreciation and amortization, gains or losses from the sales of depreciable property, extraordinary items, provisions for impairment on real estate investments and goodwill, interest expense, non-cash items such as stock compensation and write-offs of transaction costs and other one-time transactions. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors because they are widely accepted industry measures used by analysts and investors to compare the operating performance of REITs. EBITDA is not a measure of financial performance under GAAP, and our EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. You should not consider our EBITDA as an alternative to net income or cash flows from operating activities determined in accordance with GAAP.\n\nView source version on businesswire.com: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20250807008300/en/\n\nContacts\n\nInquiries: \r\nmanagement@modiv.com\n\nView Comments",

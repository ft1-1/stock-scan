            "content": "Looking at the underlying holdings of the ETFs in our coverage universe at ETF Channel, we have compared the trading price of each holding against the average analyst 12-month forward target price, and computed the weighted average implied analyst target price for the ETF itself. \tFor the iShares U.S. Real Estate ETF (Symbol: IYR), we found that the implied analyst target price for the ETF based upon its underlying holdings is $108.02 per unit.\n\nWith IYR trading at a recent price near $97.68 per unit, that means that analysts see 10.59% upside for this ETF looking through to the average analyst targets of the underlying holdings.   Three of IYR's underlying holdings with notable upside to their analyst target prices are Equity Lifestyle Properties Inc (Symbol: ELS), Rayonier Inc. (Symbol: RYN), and Gaming & Leisure Properties, Inc (Symbol: GLPI). Although ELS has traded at a recent price of $60.24/share, the average analyst target is 19.11% higher at $71.75/share. Similarly, RYN has 11.81% upside from the recent share price of $26.30 if the average analyst target price of $29.40/share is reached, and analysts on average are expecting GLPI to reach a target price of $53.43/share, which is 11.30% above the recent price of $48.01. Below is a twelve month price history chart comparing the stock performance of ELS, RYN, and GLPI:\n\nBelow is a summary table of the current analyst target prices discussed above:  NameSymbolRecent PriceAvg.

Do the analysts have a valid justification for their targets, or are they behind the curve on recent company and industry developments? A high price target relative to a stock's trading price can reflect optimism about the future, but can also be a precursor to target price downgrades if the targets were a relic of the past. These are questions that require further investor research.\n\n10 ETFs With Most Upside To Analyst Targets »\n\nAlso see:\n\n Top Stocks Held By George Soros\r\n  MOO YTD Return\r\n  WLFC market cap history </p>\n\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.",

            "content": "Equity LifeStyle Properties, Inc. (NYSE:ELS) is one of the best residential REITs to buy. On July 15, Morgan Stanley began coverage of ELS with an Equal Weight rating and assigned a price target of $67.5.\n\nThe firm anticipates year-over-year growth in Core Income from Property Operations for ELS at 5.6% in 2025, 4.5% in 2026, and 4.7% in 2027. The company also maintains a robust track record of shareholder returns, with 19 years of consistent dividend increases.Morgan Stanley Starts Coverage of Equity LifeStyle Properties (ELS) with an Equal Weight Rating\n\n20 Major Cities with the Highest Home Price Increases Since the Pandemic\n\nMorgan Stanley added that ELS is positioned for steady growth, with steady mid-single digit gains from internal operations and moderate external expansion, given tight cap rates on premium manufactured housing assets. Together, these factors are expected to support around 4.5% annual growth in FFO and AFFO per share from 2025 to 2027.\n\nResearch indicates that manufactured housing REITs are expected to lag the broader REIT sector in FFO growth through 2025 and 2026, following a weak 2024.\n\nEquity LifeStyle Properties, Inc. (NYSE:ELS) is an American operator of manufactured home communities, RV resorts, and campgrounds in North America, offering a range of housing and recreational options in high-demand locations to meet diverse customer needs.\n\nWhile we acknowledge the potential of ELS as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.

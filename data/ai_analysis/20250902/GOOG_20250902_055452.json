            "title": "Global-local alliance powers a new era in Japan's geothermal energy",
            "content": "Swedish company Baseload Capital today announced a strategic investment in Japanese geothermal energy developer Furusato Netsuden. The partnership aims to unlock Japan's untapped geothermal potential and build a replicable model for sustainable energy development worldwide.\n\nSTOCKHOLM, Sept. 1, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Combining a global investment portfolio with a community-rooted business model, this strategic partnership aims to scale clean, renewable energy respectfully, revitalizing local economies while honoring cultural heritage.\n\nFurusato Netsuden brings deep local roots, trust, and operational expertise to the partnership, while Baseload Capital contributes international investment, global reach and the power of committed owners such as Google and Breakthrough Energy Ventures.\n\nJapan's untapped geothermal power\n\nJapan has the third largest geothermal potential globally, with an estimated 23 GW, yet its current installed capacity is only 576 MW. This represents a major untapped opportunity for a country whose Green Transformation (GX) Strategy aims for net-zero emissions by 2050. Geothermal energy is clean, always-on, and space-efficient. That makes it an ideal solution for a mountainous, densely populated nation with high reliance on energy imports and growing clean-energy demand from AI and data centers.\n\nJapan's geothermal development has been slow, in part, because there's no common business model that enables communities to share in the benefits. However, Furusato Netsuden and its local partners have developed a system to ensure communities benefit directly from geothermal energy.\n\nThe Waita model – a ground-breaking approach\n\nIn 2011, residents of the Waita area in Oguni Town, Kumamoto Prefecture, formed the limited liability company Waita-kai, which is owned by the community. In partnership with Furusato Netsuden, they set out to develop geothermal power together in a way that would revitalize the community. The name Furusato Netsuden combines the words for \"hometown\", \"heat\" and \"electricity\".\n\nA respectful and collaborative business model\n\nThis model protects local land rights, ensures development is carried out on a scale appropriate for the area, and guarantees some of the revenues are re-invested in the community. Furusato Netsuden and Waita-kai regularly hold meetings with residents to share updates on operations, development, and environmental monitoring.\n\nA growing geothermal portfolio\n\nIn 2015, the 2 MW capacity Waita No. 1 geothermal power plant began commercial operation. Waita No. 2, currently under construction, is expected to deliver 5 MW and go online in March 2026. In addition to the 7MW currently operating or under construction in Waita, the overall portfolio includes a tangible pipeline of projects across Japan that are expected to deliver an additional 30+ MW over the next five to ten years.\n\nStory Continues\n\nAlexander Helling, CEO, Baseload Capital\n\n\"Furusato Netsuden has successfully proven that community-based geothermal development works. Through this first investment, we're proud and humbled to partner with them in scaling this approach, combining local engagement with sustainable energy development. Together, we aim to help Japan reach its 1.5 GW geothermal goal and strengthen national energy resilience.\"\n\nKazuyuki Akaishi, Representative Director, Furusato Netsuden\n\n\"Since 2020, we've built a foundation of trust with Baseload Capital, and seen that they are a committed, long-term partner in Japan's energy transition. Their role as a strategic investor provides financial stability for our current and future projects. They also bring valuable global resources, including technology, business insights and an international network of investors and energy partners.\"\n\nCarmichael Roberts, Breakthrough Energy Ventures\r\n\"Geothermal is one of the largest untapped opportunities in the global clean energy transition—providing reliable, carbon-free heat and power that can strengthen energy security and serve communities worldwide,\" said Carmichael Roberts, Breakthrough Energy Ventures. \"Baseload Capital is demonstrating how to unlock this potential by working hand in hand with trusted local partners like Furusato Netsuden. This partnership is a model for how communities across the globe can harness geothermal power.\"\n\nThe goal of this partnership is to support Japan's 7th Strategic Energy Plan and GX (Green Transformation) while establishing a scalable, community-focused blueprint for clean energy development - creating global impact with local roots.\n\nAbout Baseload Capital \r\nWe lead partnerships to scale up geothermal energy: a 24/7 available source of clean power and heat. Our global portfolio de-risks investments, expands the market and accelerates learnings in collaboration with strong owners and partners.\n\nOur parent company Baseload Capital invests in geothermal projects worldwide. Our subsidiaries, the Baseload Power companies, build, commission and operate geothermal heat and power plants funded by Baseload Capital.\n\nAbout Furusato Netsuden\n\nOur mission is to promote a geothermal power generation model that can coexist with the local community and revitalize rural areas, while also effectively utilizing geothermal resources in the carbon-neutral era.\n\nFurusato Netsuden was established in 2012. Apart from our existing power plant and project pipeline, we are also advancing development in other regions in Japan and aim to expand this community-friendly model nationwide alongside Baseload Capital and our existing shareholders, including NTT Anode Energy Corporation, Rezil Inc., Matsuoka Kenki Co., Ltd., and The Kansai Electric Power Co., Inc.

            "content": "This article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nSep 1 - Marvell Technology (NASDAQ:MRVL) saw its shares tumble nearly 18% on Friday after the company reported second-quarter results that came in slightly below Wall Street expectations. While the semiconductor maker missed revenue estimates by a narrow margin, the broader story shows a company still riding powerful growth trends in the data center and artificial intelligence markets.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Signs with MRVL. Is MRVL fairly valued? Test your thesis with our free DCF calculator.\n\nThe chipmaker posted quarterly revenue above $2 billion for the first time, representing 58% growth from a year earlier. Data center sales made up $1.5 billion, or roughly three-quarters of total revenue, underscoring Marvell's reliance on AI-focused infrastructure spending by hyperscale customers such as Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG). Other business lines, including enterprise networking, carrier infrastructure, consumer, and automotive, accounted for the remaining share.\n\nOn the profitability side, Marvell delivered $1.2 billion in gross profit with a non-GAAP margin of 59.4%. Adjusted net income more than doubled year over year to $585.5 million, reflecting the company's improving operating leverage. Management also guided for third-quarter revenue of about $2.06 billion, which at the midpoint implies 36% growth.\n\nDespite the strong numbers, investors reacted negatively to the revenue miss and concerns over the foundry cycle, triggering the sharp sell-off. Analysts, however, note that Marvell trades below both its historical valuation multiples and the broader industry average. With data center capital spending accelerating and AI demand surging, many see the pullback as an opportunity rather than a red flag.\n\nMarvell's outlook suggests annualized revenue could surpass $10 billion by the end of fiscal 2026. While risks remain if hyperscalers slow AI spending or if margins weaken, the company's positioning in semiconductors for cloud, AI, and networking continues to attract long-term investors.\n\nIs MRVL Stock a Buy?Marvell Technology: AI Growth Overshadowed by Market Panic\n\nBased on the one year price targets offered by 36 analysts, the average target price for Marvell Technology Inc is $88.42 with a high estimate of $135.00 and a low estimate of $64.31. The average target implies a upside of +40.65% from the current price of $62.87.\n\nBased on GuruFocus estimates, the estimated GF Value for Marvell Technology Inc in one year is $98.65, suggesting a upside of +56.92% from the current price of $62.87.\n\nView Comments",

            "title": "Chegg Turns to AI for Efficiency: Enough to Offset Subscriber Decline?",
            "content": "Chegg, Inc. CHGG is leaning heavily on artificial intelligence (“AI”) to reshape its business model as it navigates a turbulent period marked by sharp subscriber losses. The education-technology firm reported second-quarter 2025 revenues of $105.1 million, down 36% year over year, with subscription services revenue falling 39% to $89.7 million. The subscriber base plunged 40% to 2.6 million, largely due to lower traffic stemming from Google’s AI Overviews.\r\n\r\nYet management is betting that efficiency gains and product reinvention will stabilize the business. Chegg has embedded AI across Chegg Study, launching tools like Solution Scout and AI-driven flashcard generators. The company says these innovations are improving engagement, with reported gains in retention and satisfaction. AI is also cutting operating costs—non-GAAP expenses fell 33% in the second quarter—helping Chegg deliver $23.1 million in adjusted EBITDA despite revenue headwinds.\r\n\r\nGrowth segments Busuu and Skills are bright spots. Busuu’s language-learning platform posted 15% revenue growth, led by a 39% surge in its B2B business. Skills, focused on workplace readiness, saw 16% enrollment growth quarter-over-quarter, positioning both businesses as long-term growth drivers.\r\n\r\nLooking ahead, management guided third-quarter revenues down to $75–77 million, reflecting ongoing traffic pressures. While cost discipline and AI-enabled efficiencies are cushioning profitability, the key question for investors is whether AI can do more than reduce costs—can it drive sustainable growth in a competitive, AI-disrupted edtech landscape? With Chegg in the midst of a strategic review, the next few quarters will be critical in proving whether efficiency gains can offset declining scale.\n\nCompetitive Pressures From EdTech Rivals\n\nChegg’s challenges in balancing AI adoption with subscriber declines come against the backdrop of intensifying competition from peers like Coursera COUR and Duolingo DUOL. Coursera, a leading online learning platform, has leaned into AI-driven personalization and enterprise partnerships to expand beyond its core university alliances. Coursera continues to build traction in professional upskilling—a direct overlap with Chegg’s Skills business—raising the stakes as both companies court corporate and institutional clients.

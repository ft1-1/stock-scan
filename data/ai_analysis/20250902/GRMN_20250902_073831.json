            "title": "Garmin Ltd (NYSE:GRMN) Identified by Minervini's Trend Template and High Growth Momentum Screen",
            "content": "Garmin Ltd (NYSE:GRMN [https://www.chartmill.com/stock/quote/GRMN]) has been identified through a screening process that combines Mark Minervini’s Trend Template with a High Growth Momentum (HGM) rating. This dual method confirms that chosen stocks show both solid technical momentum, meaning they are in a good uptrend, and display fundamental growth traits that interest momentum and growth investors. The strategy highlights the need to match technical health with improving business results, a method Minervini has used effectively to get returns that beat the market.\n[Garmin Ltd stock chart]\nGarmin meets all main parts of Minervini’s Trend Template, which is made to find stocks in a confirmed Stage 2 climb, marked by increasing moving averages, good relative strength, and price movement close to new highs. The stock is trading above its 50-day ($224.05), 150-day ($212.43), and 200-day ($212.31) simple moving averages, with all three moving up. This agreement points to continued positive momentum across short, medium, and long-term periods. Also, the present price of $241.82 is over 30% above its 52-week low of $160.94 and within 2% of its 52-week high of $246.50, meeting Minervini’s rule for stocks to display a major recovery and trade near new highs to confirm strength. The stock’s relative strength ranking of 83.92 further confirms its status of doing better than the market.\n\nFrom a growth viewpoint, Garmin shows solid fundamental momentum, a central part of Minervini’s SEPA® methodology, which looks for companies with getting better sales, earnings, and profit margins. The company’s trailing twelve-month (TTM) earnings per share (EPS) grew 33.44% year-over-year, while revenue rose 19.65% over the same time. Recent quarterly results are even more notable, with EPS growth of 37.34% and sales growth of 20.44% in the latest quarter. The company has exceeded EPS estimates in three of the past four quarters by an average of 14.77%, showing a habit of positive surprises that frequently draw institutional attention. Profit margins stayed good at 22.09% for the last quarter, and free cash flow per share grew 30.27% over the past year, highlighting the company’s financial health and capacity to finance future expansion.\n\nThese growth measures are important within Minervini’s structure because steady fundamental betterment often comes before and goes along with major price gains. Stocks that display a quickening in earnings and revenue, especially when joined with high relative strength and good chart patterns, are more prone to continue their uptrend as they get noticed by growth and momentum investors.\n\nTechnically, Garmin is in a good state. The stock gets a complete ChartMill Technical Rating of 10, showing very good trend condition, while its setup rating of 3 implies it might be stretched in the near term and could gain from a pause before offering a more favorable entry. Support levels are clear, with the closest major support area around $232,$234, giving a possible zone for pullbacks to stay. With both short and long-term trends positive and the stock trading near 52-week highs, the technical base stays firm.\n\nFor a more detailed technical assessment, readers can see the full technical report for Garmin [https://www.chartmill.com/stock/quote/GRMN/technical-analysis].\n\nInvestors wanting to find more stocks that fit this high-growth, high-momentum method might look into other choices using the High Growth Momentum + Trend Template screen [https://www.chartmill.com/stock/stock-screener?sid=718&f=sm50v_a_sm150v,sm50v_a_sm200v,sl_crs_70_X,sm200v_r,sm150v_a_sm200v,v1_50b100,cu_a_sm50v,cu_a_sm150v,cu_a_sm200v,sl_ratingHgm_6_X,exch_us&v=3&s=ta&sd=DESC&cpl=2&bc=true&nw=1&pam=1&pm=1&set=1&uc=7054723&dc=14111810&o1=3&op1=200,16711680&o2=3&op2=50,255&o3=1&o4=89&op4=40,1,10536676&cf=%28h%3E%3D%28wh52*0.75%29%29,%28cu%3E%3D%28wl52*1.3%29%29].\n\n_Disclaimer: This is not investment advice.

            "title": "Garmin (GRMN) Up 10.2% Since Last Earnings Report: Can It Continue?",
            "content": "It has been about a month since the last earnings report for Garmin (GRMN). Shares have added about 10.2% in that time frame, outperforming the S&P 500.\n\nBut investors have to be wondering, will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Garmin due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the latest earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.\n\nGarmin's Q2 Earnings Beat Expectations, Revenues Increase Y/Y\n\nGarmin reported second-quarter 2025 pro forma earnings of $2.17 per share, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 10.7%. Moreover, the bottom line improved 37% on a year-over-year basis.\n\nNet sales were $1.81 billion, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 4.4%. Moreover, the figure increased 20% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nGRMN’s year-over-year growth in the top line was attributed to the solid momentum across the Outdoor, Fitness, Aviation, Marine and Auto OEM segments.\n\nGarmin’s Segmental Details\n\nOutdoor (27% of Net Sales): The segment generated sales of $490.4 million in the reported quarter, up 11% year over year, primarily driven by strong performance in adventure watches. Operating income was $158 million, with a 32% operating margin. Our model estimate for the Outdoor segment was pegged at $469.1 million.\n\nFitness (33.4%): The segment recorded sales of $605.4 million, reflecting a 41% year-over-year increase, led by robust demand for advanced wearables. Operating income was $198 million, with a 33% operating margin. Our model estimate for the Fitness segment was pegged at $482.5 million.\n\nAviation (13.7%): The segment achieved sales of $249.4 million, up 14% year over year, fueled by strength in OEM and aftermarket product categories. Operating income came in at $63 million, with a 25% margin. Our model estimate for the Aviation segment was pegged at $245.8 million.\n\nMarine (16.5%): Garmin posted sales of $299.3 million, up 10% year-over year due to growth led by chartplotters. Operating income was $63 million, resulting in a 21% margin. Our model estimate for the Marine segment was pegged at $340.4 million.\n\nAuto OEM (9.4%): Sales reached $170.2 million, marking a 16% year-over-year increase due to higher domain controller shipments. The segment posted an operating loss of $10 million, with a gross margin of 6%. Our model estimate for the Auto OEM segment was pegged at $185.5 million.\n\nGarmin’s Operating Results\n\nGross profit grew 24% year over year to $1.07 billion in the second quarter. Garmin’s gross margin improved 150 basis points year over year to 58.8%.\n\nStory Continues\n\nGRMN’s operating expenses of $595 million grew 14% from the prior-year quarter.\n\nOperating income rose 38% year over year to $472.3 million, while operating margin expanded 330 basis points to 26%.\n\nBalance Sheet & Cash Flow of GRMN\n\nAs of June 28, 2025, Garmin held $2.59 billion in cash and marketable securities, down from $2.67 billion in the previous quarter.\n\nDuring the second quarter, the company generated operating cash flow and free cash flow of $173 million and $127 million, respectively. In the first half of 2025, Garmin generated operating and free cash flows of $594 million and $508.2 million, respectively.\n\nGarmin Updates Guidance for 2025\n\nBuoyed by a strong second-quarter performance, Garmin raised revenues and EPS guidance for 2025. Garmin now expects 2025 revenues to be $7.1 billion, up from the previous guidance of $6.85 billion. Garmin now anticipates pro forma EPS to be $8.00, up from the earlier projection of $7.80.\n\nHowever, it still expects a gross margin of 58.5% and an operating margin of 24.8% for 2025. The pro forma effective tax rate forecast has been increased to 17.5% from 16.5% projected earlier.\n\nHow Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?\n\nIn the past month, investors have witnessed a upward trend in estimates revision.\n\nVGM Scores\n\nAt this time, Garmin has a subpar Growth Score of D, a grade with the same score on the momentum front. Following the exact same course, the stock has a score of D on the value side, putting it in the bottom 40% for value investors.\n\nOverall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of D. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.\n\nOutlook\n\nEstimates have been broadly trending upward for the stock, and the magnitude of these revisions looks promising. It comes with little surprise Garmin has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). We expect an above average return from the stock in the next few months.\n\nPerformance of an Industry Player\n\nGarmin belongs to the Zacks Electronics - Miscellaneous Products industry. Another stock from the same industry, Flex (FLEX), has gained 9.8% over the past month. More than a month has passed since the company reported results for the quarter ended June 2025.\n\nFlex reported revenues of $6.58 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +4.1%. EPS of $0.72 for the same period compares with $0.51 a year ago.\n\nFlex is expected to post earnings of $0.75 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +17.2%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged.\n\nFlex has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) based on the overall direction and magnitude of estimate revisions. Additionally, the stock has a VGM Score of A.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.

            "content": "Mountain View, California-based Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL) is a multinational technology conglomerate holding company offering various products and platforms. With a market cap of $2.5 trillion, GOOGL provides web-based search, advertisements, maps, software applications, mobile operating systems, consumer content, enterprise solutions, commerce, and hardware products.\n\nCompanies worth $200 billion or more are generally described as “mega-cap stocks,” and GOOGL definitely fits that description, with its market cap exceeding this threshold, reflecting its substantial size, influence, and dominance in the internet content & information industry. The internet media giant has been a leader in artificial intelligence (AI) for years, utilizing AI as a key component of Google's search algorithm.\n\nMore News from Barchart\n\nNvidia CEO Jenson Huang: Amazon, Oracle, Alphabet, and Microsoft Alone Plan to Spend ‘$600 Billion Per Year’ on the ‘AI Revolution’ A $10 Billion Reason to Buy Google Stock Now These 2 Healthcare Stocks Are Even Better Bargain Buys Than UnitedHealth Markets move fast. Keep up by reading our FREE midday Barchart Brief newsletter for exclusive charts, analysis, and headlines.\n\nDespite its notable strength, GOOGL shares touched their 52-week high of $212.22 in the last trading session. Shares of Alphabet gained 22.8% over the past three months, outpacing the Invesco NASDAQ Internet ETF’s (PNQI) 10.8% returns during the same time frame.www.barchart.com\n\nIn the longer term, shares of Alphabet rose 11.8% on a YTD basis and climbed 30% over the past 52 weeks, underperforming PNQI’s YTD gains of 16.2% and a solid 33.2% return over the last year.\n\nTo confirm the bullish trend, Alphabet is trading above its 50-day moving average since mid-May. The stock has been trading above its 200-day moving average since early June, with slight fluctuations.www.barchart.com\n\nGoogle's underperformance stems from intensifying AI competition from startups like OpenAI's ChatGPT and regulatory challenges, including a potential breakup that could force the sale of Chrome, as the company tries to maintain dominance in search with its new AI features. Additionally, Alphabet faces stiff competition from companies like Apple Inc. (AAPL) and Garmin Ltd. (GRMN) in the smartphone and wearable device markets.\n\nOn Jul. 23, GOOGL shares closed down marginally after reporting its Q2 results. Its EPS of $2.31 topped Wall Street expectations of $2.15. The company’s revenue was $96.4 billion, topping Wall Street forecasts of $79.5 billion.\n\nStory Continues\n\nIn the competitive arena of internet content & information, Meta Platforms, Inc. (META) has taken the lead over Alphabet, showing resilience with a 28.3% uptick on a YTD basis and a solid 45.3% gain over the past 52 weeks.\n\nWall Street analysts are bullish on GOOGL’s prospects. The stock has a consensus “Strong Buy” rating from the 54 analysts covering it, and the mean price target of $220.43 suggests a potential upside of 4.2% from current price levels.\n\nOn the date of publication, Neha Panjwani did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

            "content": "GoPro (GPRO) stock appears to be the latest beneficiary of meme stock action, as shares jumped 30% on Aug. 25 despite an absence of company news or regulatory filings. The company followed that up with an additional 9% gain on Aug. 26, on the strength of the company’s early-stage rollout of its artificial intelligence (AI) data licensing pilot program.\n\nHowever, Wall Street analysts remain unconvinced, and based on the average price target for GPRO stock, shares are at risk of falling 50%. So, the stock may be overheated despite the excitement from this week.\n\nMore News from Barchart\n\nDear Broadcom Stock Fans, Mark Your Calendars for September 4 After a 222% Surge, Is SoFi Stock Headed Even Higher?

Keep up by reading our FREE midday Barchart Brief newsletter for exclusive charts, analysis, and headlines.\n\nAbout GoPro Stock\n\nCalifornia-based GoPro is best known for making handheld video cameras that can be mounted on vehicles, helmets, and other gear. They are popular among content creators, athletes, and people doing adventure sports because they show immersive, first-person footage. The company also sells mounts and accessories for their cameras and operates a mobile app that allows users to control cameras remotely, edit footage, post to social media, and store files in the cloud.\n\nThe company has a market capitalization of only $268 million. Shares are up 37% in the last 12 months, beating the Nasdaq Composite’s ($NASX) gain of 22%, but have been exceptionally volatile. GoPro stock has been as low as $0.40 per share in the last 52 weeks and rose as high as $2.37.\n\nThe stock trades at a price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 0.3, indicating that the stock is undervalued. By way of comparison, Sony Group (SONY) has a forward P/S of 2, while Garmin (GRMN) operates at a forward P/S of 6.3.www.barchart.com\n\nGoPro Beats on Earnings\n\nGoPro reported second-quarter earnings on Aug. 11. Revenue was $153 million, down 18% from a year ago. The company reported a loss of $0.10 per share, but that was a penny better than analysts had expected. The report continued GoPro’s recent trend of managing to beat on earnings but still recording net losses.www.barchart.com\n\nThe company reported sales of 500,000 camera units, down 23% from a year ago, and that GoPro subscriber count dropped 3% to 2.45 million. Retail revenue makes up 79% of GoPro’s overall revenue, but that was down 19% from a year ago. Revenue from the company’s website and subscriptions was down 16% from the same period last year.\n\nStory Continues\n\n“Our priorities for the balance of 2025 and into 2026 continue to be managing operating expenses, protecting our (intellectual property), and launching new products, which we believe will return GoPro to both unit and revenue growth, and improve profitability, starting in the fourth quarter of this year,” CEO Nicholas Woodman said.\n\nPart of that involves the company’s new AI program. GoPro’s opt-in program allows subscribers to monetize their GoPro cloud-based videos by making them available to train AI models. GoPro says subscribers will earn 50% of the licensing revenue that GoPro expects to generate. The company says it has 13 million hours of video that potentially could be in the program. It also announced on Aug. 26 that subscribers have already opted in more than 125,000 hours of content.\n\nThe company issued third-quarter guidance for revenue of $160 million, down 38% from a year ago, and a loss of $0.04 per share.\n\nWhat Do Analysts Expect for GPRO Stock?\n\nOnly two analysts currently cover GoPro, but that’s to be expected because the company has a low market capitalization. One lists GPRO stock as a “Strong Sell” and the other has the stock as a “Hold.”\n\nBoth analysts have a price target of $0.80 on GoPro stock, indicating potentially a 53% drop in the coming months. Until GoPro demonstrates consistent profitability and stabilizes its subscriber base, Wall Street’s outlook suggests caution is warranted. Considering the company’s continued lack of profits, its shrinking customer base, and analyst sentiment, GoPro appears to be a risky investment now.www.barchart.com\n\nOn the date of publication, Patrick Sanders did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

            "title": "October 10th Options Now Available For DocuSign (DOCU)",
            "content": "Investors in DocuSign Inc (Symbol: DOCU) saw new options become available today, for the October 10th expiration.   At Stock Options Channel, our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the DOCU options chain for the new October 10th contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.\n\nThe put contract at the $63.00 strike price has a current bid of $1.01.  If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $63.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $61.99 (before broker commissions).  To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of DOCU, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $75.23/share today.\n\nBecause the $63.00 strike represents an approximate 16% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless.  The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 82%.  Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the contract detail page for this contract.  Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 1.60% return on the cash commitment, or 13.61% annualized — at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost.\n\nBelow is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for DocuSign Inc, and highlighting in green where the $63.00 strike is located relative to that history:\n\nTurning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $77.00 strike price has a current bid of $4.80.  If an investor was to purchase shares of DOCU stock at the current price level of $75.23/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a \"covered call,\" they are committing to sell the stock at $77.00.  Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 8.73% if the stock gets called away at the October 10th expiration (before broker commissions).  Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if DOCU shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for DocuSign Inc, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important.   Below is a chart showing DOCU's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $77.00 strike highlighted in red:\n\nConsidering the fact that the $77.00 strike represents an approximate 2% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected.  The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 50%.  On our website under the contract detail page for this contract, Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted).   Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 6.38% boost of extra return to the investor, or 54.16% annualized, which we refer to as the YieldBoost.\n\nThe implied volatility in the put contract example is 67%, while the implied volatility in the call contract example is 55%.\n\nMeanwhile, we calculate the actual trailing twelve month volatility (considering the last 250 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $75.23) to be 53%.

            "content": "The proven Zacks Rank system focuses on earnings estimates and estimate revisions to find winning stocks. Nevertheless, we know that our readers all have their own perspectives, so we are always looking at the latest trends in value, growth, and momentum to find strong picks.\n\nConsidering these trends, value investing is clearly one of the most preferred ways to find strong stocks in any type of market. Value investors rely on traditional forms of analysis on key valuation metrics to find stocks that they believe are undervalued, leaving room for profits.\n\nLuckily, Zacks has developed its own Style Scores system in an effort to find stocks with specific traits. Value investors will be interested in the system's \"Value\" category. Stocks with both \"A\" grades in the Value category and high Zacks Ranks are among the strongest value stocks on the market right now.\n\nOne stock to keep an eye on is GARRETT MOTION (GTX). GTX is currently sporting a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and an A for Value. The stock has a Forward P/E ratio of 9.09. This compares to its industry's average Forward P/E of 21.20. Over the last 12 months, GTX's Forward P/E has been as high as 9.56 and as low as 5.83, with a median of 7.38.\n\nValue investors also frequently use the P/S ratio. This metric is found by dividing a stock's price with the company's revenue. Some people prefer this metric because sales are harder to manipulate on an income statement. This means it could be a truer performance indicator. GTX has a P/S ratio of 0.76. This compares to its industry's average P/S of 0.77.\n\nThese are only a few of the key metrics included in GARRETT MOTION's strong Value grade, but they help show that the stock is likely undervalued right now. When factoring in the strength of its earnings outlook, GTX looks like an impressive value stock at the moment.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

            "title": "Garrett Motion Inc. (NASDAQ:GTX) Stock Goes Ex-Dividend In Just Three Days",
            "content": "Garrett Motion Inc. (NASDAQ:GTX) is about to trade ex-dividend in the next 3 days. The ex-dividend date occurs one day before the record date, which is the day on which shareholders need to be on the company's books in order to receive a dividend. It is important to be aware of the ex-dividend date because any trade on the stock needs to have been settled on or before the record date. This means that investors who purchase Garrett Motion's shares on or after the 2nd of September will not receive the dividend, which will be paid on the 16th of September.\n\nThe company's next dividend payment will be US$0.06 per share, on the back of last year when the company paid a total of US$0.24 to shareholders. Looking at the last 12 months of distributions, Garrett Motion has a trailing yield of approximately 1.8% on its current stock price of US$13.05. We love seeing companies pay a dividend, but it's also important to be sure that laying the golden eggs isn't going to kill our golden goose! So we need to check whether the dividend payments are covered, and if earnings are growing.\n\nTrump has pledged to \"unleash\" American oil and gas and these 15 US stocks have developments that are poised to benefit.\n\nDividends are typically paid out of company income, so if a company pays out more than it earned, its dividend is usually at a higher risk of being cut. Garrett Motion has a low and conservative payout ratio of just 8.3% of its income after tax. Yet cash flow is typically more important than profit for assessing dividend sustainability, so we should always check if the company generated enough cash to afford its dividend. Luckily it paid out just 7.6% of its free cash flow last year.\n\nIt's positive to see that Garrett Motion's dividend is covered by both profits and cash flow, since this is generally a sign that the dividend is sustainable, and a lower payout ratio usually suggests a greater margin of safety before the dividend gets cut.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for Garrett Motion\n\nClick here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends.NasdaqGS:GTX Historic Dividend August 29th 2025\n\nHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?\n\nWhen earnings decline, dividend companies become much harder to analyse and own safely. If earnings decline and the company is forced to cut its dividend, investors could watch the value of their investment go up in smoke. Garrett Motion's earnings per share have fallen at approximately 19% a year over the previous five years. Ultimately, when earnings per share decline, the size of the pie from which dividends can be paid, shrinks.\n\nStory continues\n\nUnfortunately Garrett Motion has only been paying a dividend for a year or so, so there's not much of a history to draw insight from.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nIs Garrett Motion worth buying for its dividend? Earnings per share are down meaningfully, although at least the company is paying out a low and conservative percentage of both its earnings and cash flow. It's definitely not great to see earnings falling, but at least there may be some buffer before the dividend needs to be cut. Overall, it's not a bad combination, but we feel that there are likely more attractive dividend prospects out there.\n\nWhile it's tempting to invest in Garrett Motion for the dividends alone, you should always be mindful of the risks involved. To that end, you should learn about the 2 warning signs we've spotted with Garrett Motion (including 1 which is potentially serious).\n\nIf you're in the market for strong dividend payers, we recommend checking our selection of top dividend stocks.\n\nHave feedback on this article?

            "content": "Not all profitable companies are built to last - some rely on outdated models or unsustainable advantages. Just because a business is in the green today doesn’t mean it will thrive tomorrow.\n\nA business making money today isn’t necessarily a winner, which is why we analyze companies across multiple dimensions at StockStory. That said, here are three profitable companies to avoid and some better opportunities instead.\n\nJacobs Solutions (J)\n\nTrailing 12-Month GAAP Operating Margin: 7.2%\n\nWith a workforce of approximately 45,000 professionals tackling complex challenges from water scarcity to cybersecurity, Jacobs Solutions (NYSE:J) provides engineering, consulting, and technical services focused on infrastructure, sustainability, and advanced technology solutions.\n\nWhy Do We Pass on J?\n\nAnnual sales declines of 2.5% for the past five years show its products and services struggled to connect with the market during this cycle Performance over the past five years shows each sale was less profitable as its earnings per share dropped by 4% annually, worse than its revenue Below-average returns on capital indicate management struggled to find compelling investment opportunities\n\nJacobs Solutions is trading at $146.91 per share, or 21.9x forward P/E. Dive into our free research report to see why there are better opportunities than J.\n\nHexcel (HXL)\n\nTrailing 12-Month GAAP Operating Margin: 7.2%\n\nFounded shortly after World War II by a group of engineers from UC Berkley, Hexcel (NYSE:HXL) manufactures lightweight composite materials primarily for the aerospace and defense sectors.\n\nWhy Do We Avoid HXL?\n\nProducts and services are facing significant end-market challenges during this cycle as sales have declined by 1.8% annually over the last five years Earnings per share have contracted by 5.6% annually over the last five years, a headwind for returns as stock prices often echo long-term EPS performance Capital intensity has ramped up over the last five years as its free cash flow margin decreased by 8.2 percentage points\n\nAt $63.96 per share, Hexcel trades at 28.7x forward P/E.

Read our free research report to see why you should think twice about including ACN in your portfolio, it’s free.\n\nStocks We Like More\n\nTrump’s April 2025 tariff bombshell triggered a massive market selloff, but stocks have since staged an impressive recovery, leaving those who panic sold on the sidelines.\n\nTake advantage of the rebound by checking out our Top 5 Growth Stocks for this month.

            "title": "Why Is Woodward (WWD) Down 3.8% Since Last Earnings Report?",
            "content": "A month has gone by since the last earnings report for Woodward (WWD). Shares have lost about 3.8% in that time frame, underperforming the S&P 500.\n\nBut investors have to be wondering, will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Woodward due for a breakout? Well, first let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the recent drivers for Woodward, Inc. before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late.\n\nWoodward's Q3 Earnings Surpass Estimates\n\nWoodward reported third-quarter fiscal 2025 adjusted net earnings per share (EPS) of $1.76, which increased 8% year over year. The figure beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 8.6%.\n\nQuarterly net sales grew 8% year over year to $915 million and surpassed the consensus estimate by 3.1%. This growth was driven by strong performance in the Aerospace segment and the Core Industrial business.\n\nThe company’s strong year-to-date performance reinforces confidence in both its mid-term and long-term growth outlook as it continues to enhance its ability to meet sustained demand across the end markets. Given this momentum, improved macroeconomic visibility and expected continued growth, the company raised its full-year sales and earnings guidance.\n\nHowever, the company narrowed its free cash flow range. The reduction was due to increased working capital needs to support higher sales amid a dynamic supply chain and production environment.\n\nSegment Results\n\nAerospace: Net sales were $596 million, up 15.2% year over year. We predicted the metric to be $571 million. Aerospace growth was fueled by robust performance in smart defense and commercial services, partially offset by softer results in commercial OEM and defense services.\n\nDefense OEM sales increased 55.7% in the quarter to $150 million, driven by strong demand for smart defense programs. Commercial after-market sales grew 30%, driven by both pricing and higher volumes, supported by the continued high utilization of legacy aircraft.\n\nCommercial OEM sales declined 7.6% year over year to $175 million as airframers dealt with supply chain disruptions and customers actively managed their inventory levels. Defense after-market sales were down 16.2%.\n\nSegmental earnings were $126 million, up 23.5% year over year. The earnings growth was primarily driven by price realization and higher volumes, partially offset by inflationary pressure, strategic investments in manufacturing and an unfavorable product mix.\n\nIndustrial: Net sales totaled $319 million, down 3.2% year over year. We expected the metric to be $304.4 million.\n\nStory Continues\n\nWithin the Industrial segment, Transportation sales declined 12%. In the third quarter, China on-highway sales were down $36 million from a year ago.\n\nCore industrial sales, which exclude China on-highway business, were up 9%, driven by a 16% increase in Oil & Gas, a 16% increase in Marine Transportation, and Power Generation remained flat.\n\nSegmental earnings were $48 million, falling from $60 million in the year-ago quarter. Industrial earnings were affected by lower China on-highway volumes and inflationary pressures, which were partly offset by price realization.\n\nMargin Performance\n\nGross margin was up 10 basis points year over year to 27.2%.\n\nTotal costs and expenses were $788.6 million, up 8.7% year over year. Adjusted EBITDA was $165.9 million compared with $160.7 million a year ago.\n\nCash Flow & Liquidity\n\nAs of June 30, 2025, Woodward had $473.2 million in cash and cash equivalents with $503.9 million of long-term debt (less the current portion).\n\nFor the quarter ended June 30, 2025, WWD generated $126 million of net cash from operating activities compared with $153 million reported in the prior-year period.\n\nFree cash flow was $99 million compared with $137 million in the year-ago quarter. The decline was mainly due to higher working capital requirements.\n\nIn the quarter under review, WWD returned $62 million to its shareholders in the form of $17 million of dividends and $45 million worth of share repurchases.\n\nIn the first nine months of 2025, total returns to stockholders reached $172 million, including $124 million in share repurchases and $48 million in dividends.\n\nFiscal 2025 Guidance\n\nWoodward raised its sales and earnings guidance, lowering its adjusted effective tax rate and narrowing its free cash flow range.\n\nFor fiscal 2025, the company now expects consolidated sales to range between $3450 million and $3525 million compared with the prior guidance of $3,375 million and $3,500 million. Adjusted EPS is now expected to be between $6.50 and $6.75 compared with the previous guidance of $5.95 to $6.25.\n\nAerospace segment revenues are anticipated to increase in the range of 11% to 13% compared with 8-13% predicted earlier, and a decline in Industrial sales of 5% to 7% compared to the prior guidance of a decrease of 7-9%.\n\nThe company anticipates Aerospace segment margins to be between 21% and 21.5%, and Industrial margins to be approximately 14.5%.\n\nWoodward expects the adjusted effective tax rate for 2025 to be around 17% from prior guidance of 19%. Free cash flow is now projected to be between $315 million and $350 million compared to the previous guidance of $350 million to $400 million.\n\nHow Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?\n\nIn the past month, investors have witnessed a upward trend in estimates review.\n\nThe consensus estimate has shifted 8.46% due to these changes.\n\nVGM Scores\n\nCurrently, Woodward has a average Growth Score of C, a score with the same score on the momentum front. However, the stock has a grade of F on the value side, putting it in the fifth quintile for value investors.\n\nOverall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of D. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.\n\nOutlook\n\nEstimates have been trending upward for the stock, and the magnitude of these revisions looks promising. It comes with little surprise Woodward has a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). We expect an above average return from the stock in the next few months.\n\nPerformance of an Industry Player\n\nWoodward is part of the Zacks Aerospace - Defense Equipment industry. Over the past month, Hexcel (HXL), a stock from the same industry, has gained 3.6%. The company reported its results for the quarter ended June 2025 more than a month ago.\n\nHexcel reported revenues of $489.9 million in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -2.1%. EPS of $0.50 for the same period compares with $0.60 a year ago.\n\nHexcel is expected to post earnings of $0.41 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -12.8%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -9%.\n\nThe overall direction and magnitude of estimate revisions translate into a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) for Hexcel. Also, the stock has a VGM Score of D.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.

The general rise in the price of goods and services is trending towards the Fed’s 2% goal as of late, which is good news. The higher rates that fought inflation also didn't slow economic activity enough to catalyze a recession. So far, soft landing. This, combined with recent rate cuts (half a percent in September 2024 and a quarter percent in November 2024) have led to strong stock market performance in 2024. The icing on the cake for 2024 returns was Donald Trump’s victory in the U.S. Presidential Election in early November, sending major indices to all-time highs in the week following the election. Still, debates around the health of the economy and the impact of potential tariffs and corporate tax cuts remain, leaving much uncertainty around 2025.\n\nWant to invest in winners with rock-solid fundamentals?

            "title": "The White House wants government stakes in more companies. The nuclear energy industry could be next.",
            "content": "The Trump administration's move to take stakes in companies across industries may soon have a new target — nuclear power.\n\nIn a report last week, Compass Point analysts led by Whitney Stanco said the Department of Energy's recent establishment of a new consortium for nuclear fuel paves the way for the Trump administration to take stakes in companies as part of the government's quest to build a domestic supply of enriched uranium, the critical fuel used to make nuclear energy.\n\n“Given the U.S. nuclear fuel industry’s interest in roughly $3.4 billion of federal funding from Biden-era appropriations, we believe it may be a target for future similar Trump administration deals,” Stanco wrote.\n\nThe DOE’s Office of Nuclear Energy is expected to work with industry participants in the coming weeks to identify participants and long-term goals.\n\nThe Trump administration has already announced deals with Intel(INTC) and rare earths producer MP Materials (MP), both of which involved the government backing major domestic manufacturing projects. Following the Intel deal struck earlier this month, Trump and other members of the administration suggested this would be the beginning of a broader investment strategy.\n\nStanco sees Bethesda, Md-based Centrus Energy (LEU) as a likely recipient of government backing, as it is the only domestic company currently producing enriched uranium under a DOE contract. Centrus shares have rallied over 180% year to date. BWX Technologies (BWXT), a Lynchburg, Va-based company with a $15 billion market cap, is also on the analyst’s list. Its stock is up 45% year to date.\n\nNYSE American - Delayed Quote•USD\n\n(LEU)\n\nFollow  View Quote Details\n\n201.73\n\n-7.65\n\n(-3.65%)\n\nAt close: August 29 at 4:00:00 PM EDT  LEUBWXT\n\nAdvanced Chart\n\nThe Russia-Ukraine war renewed national security concerns around nuclear power, as uranium enrichment has increasingly shifted overseas. Meanwhile, the AI boom’s surging energy demands have increased interest in nuclear energy as deals between Big Tech and nuclear energy providers have put a spotlight on the sector.\n\nNuclear energy providers Constellation Energy (CEG) and Vistra (VSTR) are each up more than 35% year to date on optimism of growing power demand for data centers.At Constellation's nuclear power plant on Three Mile Island, called the Crane Clean Energy Center, near Middletown, Pa., the cooling towers are reflected in the Susquehanna River at sunrise on Wednesday, June 25, 2025. (AP Photo/Ted Shaffrey)·ASSOCIATED PRESS\n\nOn Tuesday, BofA initiated coverage of Oklo (OKLO), a builder of next-generation small nuclear reactors (SMRs), with a Buy rating. Its stock is up more than 1,000% over the last year as investors bet on nuclear energy as part of the AI trade. \"Nuclear is regaining momentum, backed by both the DOE and data center operators, with Oklo well positioned to meet the rising energy needs of AI,\" the firm wrote.\n\nAnd while the administration's high-profile Intel deal is seen as a novel arrangement, Compass Point's Stanco notes that government ownership of nuclear fuel production is not unusual around the world.\n\nStory Continues\n\nIn the US, much of the enriched uranium supply comes from Urenco, whose ownership is split among the UK and Dutch governments, along with German utilities. France, meanwhile, owns 90% of Orano, a primary enrichment company seeking to expand in the US.\n\n\"Therefore, we can see where the Trump administration may want to exert leverage through the potential funding, and, in the case of Urenco or Orano, even through trade or other sovereign negotiations, to seek more US ownership of new domestic nuclear fuel production,\" Stanco added.\n\nA 'fundamental tension'\n\nStill, questions remain on how these deals will ultimately shake out and whether the government should be doling out money in exchange for stakes.\n\n“There is a fundamental tension here,” Philip Rossetti, a resident senior fellow at the right-leaning R Street Institute, told Yahoo Finance. \"You're incentivizing these companies to try to get under this umbrella of governmental protection.”\n\n“The problem is, if that company starts to become inefficient with its production, like if it has rising production costs, or neglecting investment that would improve productivity or reduce operating costs, the bearer of those costs and inefficiencies are going to be the public,\" he added.\n\nBut the White House has signaled Intel's deal could be just the beginning of a new wave of government dealmaking under the second Trump administration.\n\nMP Materials stock surged 50% in one session in July after announcing the Pentagon would become its largest shareholder to curb reliance on Chinese rare earths. Intel shares rose 5% after the US announced a 9.9% stake in the struggling chipmaker.\n\nCommerce Secretary Howard Lutnick recently hinted the administration is considering taking a stake in defense contractor Lockheed Martin (LMT), telling CNBC there has been a \"monstrous discussion about defense.\"\n\n“The Biden administration literally was giving Intel money for free and giving TSMC money for free, and all these companies just giving the money for free,” said Lutnick.\n\n“Donald Trump turned it into saying, ‘Hey, we want equity for the money. If we’re going to give you the money, we want a piece of the action for the American taxpayer.’”\n\nInes Ferre is a Senior Business Reporter for Yahoo Finance.

            "content": "Nike and StockX have officially settled a long-running legal dispute over trademark use in sneaker-linked NFTs, bringing an end to a high-stakes court battle that has shaped how digital assets intersect with intellectual property rights.\n\nKey Takeaways:\n\nNike and StockX have settled their trademark dispute, ending a three-year legal battle over sneaker-linked NFTs. The settlement cancels a planned October jury trial, sparing both companies from potential reputational and legal damage. The case underscores growing legal scrutiny of NFTs, especially when brand usage and counterfeit claims are involved.\n\nThe resolution, filed last Friday in New York federal court, halts a jury trial that had been slated for October and dismisses all claims with prejudice.\n\nNike and StockX Avoid Legal Blow with Last-Minute Settlement\n\nThe decision spares both companies from a potentially damaging courtroom verdict.\n\nFor StockX, the settlement eliminates the risk of being found liable for broader misuse of Nike’s brand. For Nike, it avoids the uncertainty of having its IP enforcement strategies scrutinized by a jury.\n\nThe conflict began in early 2022, when Nike accused the Detroit-based marketplace of trademark infringement over its “Vault” NFTs, which featured Nike sneakers.\n\nAccording to Nike, the tokens misled consumers into thinking the company endorsed or was involved in the digital offerings.\n\nStockX countered that the NFTs merely served as digital receipts tied to physical goods, not as standalone products.\n\nTensions escalated in May 2022 when Nike amended its complaint to allege that StockX had also sold counterfeit sneakers.\n\nThose claims gained legal weight in March this year, when Judge Valerie Caproni ruled in Nike’s favor on part of the case.\n\nThe court found StockX liable for selling four fake pairs of Nike shoes to undercover investigators and an additional 33 pairs to a customer.\n\nThe remaining issues were left for a jury, until the parties reached their agreement last week.\n\nIn December last year, Nike-owned digital fashion and web3 studio RTFKT announced plans to wind down operations.\n\nAccording to an announcement shared on RTFKT’s social media channels, its Web3 services will cease by the end of January 2025. The company cited a transition to preserving its legacy through an updated website showcasing its previous projects.\n\nThe company also faced a lawsuit from a group of investors who claimed the company’s abrupt shutdown of its digital collectibles venture, RTFKT, wiped out the value of their purchases and left them facing heavy losses.\n\nThe Sandbox Founders Exit as Animoca Assumes Full Control\n\nAs reported, Metaverse platform The Sandbox is undergoing a transformation following the departure of its co-founders and a majority takeover by Animoca Brands.\n\nStory continues\n\nCo-founders Sébastien Borget and Arthur Madrid have stepped back from operational roles, with over half of the company’s workforce also let go.\n\nRobby Yung, CEO of Animoca Brands, has been appointed as the new CEO of The Sandbox.\n\nBorget remains involved as a public ambassador, while Madrid assumes a non-executive chairman position.\n\nBehind the leadership shake-up is growing dissatisfaction with The Sandbox’s performance. Despite raising $300 million over the past eight years, the platform has failed to gain traction among users.\n\nDaily active usage reportedly numbers in the low hundreds, with many flagged as bots, particularly from South America.\n\nIts native token, SAND, has fallen more than 95% from its 2021 highs, with its market cap plummeting from $8 billion to around $700 million.\n\nRead original story Nike and StockX Settle NFT Trademark Dispute, Avoid October Trial by Amin Ayan at Cryptonews.com\n\nView comments",

As per the firm analyst, NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE)’s US marketplace is expected to be largely cleaned up by September end. Also, the full price Air Force 1 sales continue to turn positive on a YoY basis, while US retailers are pleased with the Jordan Retro, the firm added.Williams Trading Raises PT on NIKE (NKE) Stock\n\nNIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE) expects the business to improve due to the progress it is making via its Win Now strategy actions. While the company’s Q4 2025 reflected the largest financial impact from its Win Now strategy actions, it expects the headwinds to moderate. Revenuesfor NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE) came in at $11.1 billion, reflecting a fall of 12% on a reported basis and down 11% on a currency-neutral basis. Notably, NIKE Direct revenues stood at $4.4 billion, down by 14% on a reported and currency-neutral basis, because of a 26% fall in NIKE Brand Digital, partially mitigated by the 2% rise in NIKE-owned stores.\n\nOakmark Funds, advised by Harris Associates, released its Q2 2025 investor letter. Here is what the fund said:\n\n“NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE) Cl B is a global leader in athletic footwear, apparel, and equipment. The company has built a leading global brand through decades of successful product innovation, marketing and partnerships with premier athletes. Since peaking in 2021, Nike’s stock price has declined to roughly a third of its previous high, largely due to challenges in its direct-to consumer initiative and concerns over tariffs. In our view, Nike’s new CEO is implementing a credible plan to improve fundamental performance by bolstering wholesaler relations and diversifying distribution while further increasing product innovation. We believe these actions will help to improve the health of the business over the medium-term, resulting in better growth and enhanced margins. These concerns provided us with the opportunity to purchase shares at a meaningful discount to our estimate of intrinsic value.”\n\nWhile we acknowledge the potential of NKE as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.

            "content": "Key Points\n\nLululemon stock is trading 60% below its 52-week high after posting a 7% revenue increase last quarter. Cava stock is down big this year, but analysts expect earnings per share to triple as it opens more restaurant locations.10 stocks we like better than Lululemon Athletica Inc. ›\n\nThe tech-driven bull market has driven up valuations for tech stocks, but this could present long-term investors attractive buying opportunities for top stocks in the consumer goods space.\n\nLululemon Athletica(NASDAQ: LULU) and Cava Group(NYSE: CAVA) are trading 60% off their previous highs, but analysts on Wall Street see value. The average price target for these stocks is at least 33% above where they currently trade.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now. Continue »\n\nHere's why they are down and might be worth buying ahead of a potential rebound in 2026.\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\n1. Lululemon Athletica\n\nLululemon Athletica has been a growing brand in the athletic wear market for two decades, but the company is struggling with slowing sales growth and higher costs from tariffs. The stock trades well below its 52-week high of $423.\n\nAfter three years of higher grocery prices and mortgage rates, consumers are pulling back on discretionary spending. This is not specific to Lululemon, but a lot of consumer brands are taking a hit. Starbucks and Nike have experienced sales pressure over the last year. After growing revenues by double-digit rates a year ago, the headwinds have finally caught up to Lululemon with sales up just 7% year over year in the most recent quarter.\n\nTariffs have compounded the company's challenges, yet despite this, the company expects revenue growth to remain stable next quarter, rising between 7% to 8% year over year. It also expects full-year earnings per share to come in between $14.58 to $14.78.\n\nApparel is highly competitive, yet that hasn't prevented Lululemon from building a strong brand over the last 20 years. It's one of the most profitable apparel brands, generating $1.8 billion in profit on $10.8 billion of revenue over the last year, which is an above-average margin of 17%.\n\nAnalysts on Wall Street have an average price target of $273 on the shares, representing upside of 33%. The stock does appear undervalued at these levels. Using management's full-year guidance, the shares trade at 14 times forward earnings. This is the lowest valuation the stock has traded in years. Just two years ago, investors were paying around 30 times earnings to own a piece of Lululemon's future growth.\n\nObviously, sentiment around the consumer goods space will dictate when the stock rebounds. But there is a catalyst that may be coming in the form of interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve that could provide some relief for consumers and potentially put Lululemon and other discounted retail stocks on a path of recovery over the next year or so.\n\nImage source: Cava.\n\n2. Cava Group\n\nCava stock rocketed to a high of $172 last year before falling to its current $68 share price. A combination of an extremely high valuation on the stock entering 2025 combined with weak consumer spending trends magnified the stock's recent slide.\n\nCava is capturing a big opportunity. It is meeting demand for a Mediterranean-based restaurant concept in the fast-casual market. It is still growing at robust rates, with total revenue up 20% year over year in the most recent quarter. But slowing customer traffic, where same-restaurant sales growth slowed to 2.1% year over year, has sent the stock lower.\n\nHowever, one silver lining in the recent quarterly financial report suggests sales growth could already be in the process of picking up again. Management indicated that same-restaurant sales were reaccelerating toward the end of the last quarter and beginning of the current quarter.\n\nCava is still investing in a huge market for Mediterranean food. It opened a net 16 new restaurants last quarter. Management still sees room for 1,000 restaurants by 2032, which would more than double its locations from the current 398.\n\nThe stock could be bottoming out, as analysts' average price target is currently $92, implying upside of 36%. The stock looks expensive at a forward P/E topping 120 at the time of writing. This is based on the Wall Street consensus earnings estimate of $0.56 for this year. But Cava is a highly profitable restaurant business. As it continues to open new locations and achieve greater scale, analysts expect Cava's earnings to nearly triple over the next four years to $1.57.\n\nFrom a price-to-sales (P/S) valuation perspective, Cava is more reasonably priced. The stock traded around 15 times sales at the start of the year but now trades at a 7.5x multiple. That's still a rich valuation for a restaurant stock, but it's justified considering Cava is still in the early innings of its nationwide expansion and is already producing a healthy profit for a restaurant business.\n\nThe lower valuation and continued execution toward its long-term strategy raise the odds of a rebound next year. If the stock continues to trade at the current P/S multiple and meets next year's consensus revenue estimate for $1.4 billion, the stock would rise 36%.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Lululemon Athletica Inc. right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Lululemon Athletica Inc., consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Lululemon Athletica Inc. wasn’t one of them.

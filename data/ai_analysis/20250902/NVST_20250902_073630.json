            "title": "Charles River Stock May Benefit From Joining EASYGEN Consortium",
            "content": "Charles River Laboratories International, Inc. CRL is now part of the EASYGEN (Easy Workflow Integration for Gene Therapy) Consortium — a European Union-backed effort designed to produce CAR-T cell therapies faster, make them more affordable and widely accessible throughout Europe. The five-year research project is funded by the Innovative Health Initiative Joint Undertaking under grant agreement No 101194710, and involves collaboration among 18 leading academic, research, industry and clinical partners across eight countries.\n\nThe Consortium’s goal is to develop a fully automated, hospital-based platform capable of manufacturing personalized cell therapies within 24 hours.\n\nCRL Stock’s Likely Trend Following the News\n\nSince the announcement on Aug. 26, shares of Charles River dipped 0.2%, closing at $163.31 last Friday. Oncology remains a key therapeutic area for the company, where time is critical in treating complex cancers. With the current manufacturing process for CAR-T therapies being time-consuming and significantly limiting their clinical use, Charles River hopes to create a streamlined workflow by collaborating across industry and academia to increase access to these therapies for patients who need them. The latest development should positively boost market sentiment surrounding the stock.\n\nCharles River has a market capitalization of $8.04 billion. The company’s earnings yield of 6.19% compares favorably with the industry’s 4.04% yield. In the trailing four quarters, it delivered an average earnings surprise of 12.8%.\n\nMore on Charles River’s Inclusion in EASYGEN\n\nCAR-T cell therapy represents a major advancement in cancer treatment, yet less than 20% of eligible patients currently receive it. These therapies typically involve genetically altering a patient’s T cell to target cancer — a process that requires complex, time-intensive production in specialized facilities often located far from patients. Limited manufacturing capacity and supply-chain delays hinder timely patient access.Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nCharles River will leverage its deep institutional expertise in 3D screening technologies to develop an ex vivo platform to speed up early screening for safety and efficacy. By leveraging access to the company’s well-annotated patient-derived xenograft (PDX) bank in combination with high-content imaging read-outs, the new 3D screening platform will enable the fast identification of the safest and most efficacious CAR-T cell candidate for subsequent development.\n\nIndustry Prospects Favoring Charles River\n\nPer a Grand View Research report, the global CAR T-cell therapy market was valued at $4.65 billion in 2024 and is expected to grow at a compound annual rate of 22.2% through 2030. The rising cases of cancer malignancies continue to fuel the market for CAR T-cell therapy. Additionally, multiple product launches and approvals are giving market players significant traction. The lymphoma segment held the largest CAR T-cell therapy market share in 2024 and is also expected to be the fastest-growing segment over the forecast period.\n\nStory Continues\n\nOther Developments at Charles River\n\nIn July, CRL and BioTech Social Inc. announced that they are exploring a potential client-centric collaboration, enabling participants at the Charles River Incubator and Accelerator Program to access the BioTech Funding Portal — an investment crowdfunding platform for life science companies. If formalized, the contemplated strategic partnership would allow early-stage cell and gene therapy (CGT) developers to raise up to $5 million per year via the platform, accelerating development and enabling therapies to reach patients more quickly.\n\nCRL Stock Price Performance\n\nIn the past year, Charles River shares have fallen 17.5% compared with the industry’s 17.3% decline.\n\nCRL’s Zacks Rank and Other Key Picks\n\nCharles River carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).\n\nSome other top-ranked stocks in the broader medical space include Envista NVST, Masimo MASI and Phibro Animal Health PAHC. Each of them carries a Zacks Rank #2 at present. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nEstimates for Envista’s 2025 earnings per share have increased 7.6% in the past 30 days. Shares of the company have rallied 16.7% in the past year compared with the industry’s 5.2% rise. Its earnings yield of 5.4% also outpaced the industry’s -0.9% yield. NVST’s earnings surpassed estimates in each of the trailing four quarters, the average surprise being 16.5%.\n\nMasimo shares have jumped 18.9% in the past year. Estimates for the company’s 2025 earnings per share have increased 5.2% to $5.24 in the past 30 days.

            "title": "Is it Apt to Hold Bio-Rad Stock in Your Portfolio Now?",
            "content": "Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc. BIO is well-poised to grow in the upcoming quarters, courtesy of its strong traction in the QX600 Droplet Digital PCR (ddPCR) platform. Demand for its quality control and immunology products in Clinical Diagnostics also remains strong. In addition, solid financial health boosts the stock’s appeal. Meanwhile, intense rival pressure and end-market softness may restrict Bio-Rad’s full growth potential.\n\nIn the past year, shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have fallen 11.7% against the industry’s 3.4% growth. The S&P 500 composite has seen a 15.7% rise in the same time frame.\n\nThe renowned manufacturer and global supplier of clinical diagnostics and life science research products has a market capitalization of $8.06 billion. Bio-Rad’s earnings surpassed estimates in three of the trailing four quarters and missed in one, the average surprise being 34.5%.\n\nLet’s delve deeper.\n\nTailwinds for Bio-Rad\n\nDigital PCR Business Backs BIO’s Growth: Bio-Rad’s QX600 ddPCR platform is currently robust and growing. This year, the company also introduced key assay expansions, including enhancements to the Vericheck assays for cell and gene therapy, showing a strong correlation between circulating tumor DNA and treatment outcomes in lung cancer. On June 30, Bio-Rad acquired Stilla Technologies to strengthen its ddPCR offering and facilitate entry into new molecular testing markets. Coinciding with this, the company launched the rebranded QX700 Series ddPCR instruments, which, together with QX Continuum, enhance the ddPCR portfolio for customers requiring a simplified workflow and flexibility at various budget levels. Following the Stilla acquisition, the company now expects ddPCR portfolio revenues to grow in the mid-single digits in 2025.Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nClinical Diagnostics Continues to Gain Momentum: The business has now returned to its normalized growth rate post-pandemic, maintaining strong market positions globally for its platforms. Built on its long-standing reputation as a leading blood screening systems provider, Bio-Rad’s IH-500 blood typing system is considered a gold standard in immunohematology labs, offering the highest level of automation. The company introduced the IH-500 NEXT System in 2023, a fully automated system for ID cards to meet emerging demands and challenges in laboratory and health environments. Bio-Rad continues to invest in supporting the growth of this segment while building a position in the new molecular diagnostics segment. In the second quarter of 2025, Bio-Rad sustained solid demand for its quality control and immunology products.\n\nStory Continues\n\nStrong Solvency and Balance Sheet: Bio-Rad exited the second quarter of 2025 with cash and cash equivalents (including short-term investments) of $1.37 billion, and $1 million in short-term debt. Total debt (including current maturities) at the end of the second quarter was $1.20 billion, in line with the previous quarter’s level. The reported figure was lower than the corresponding cash, cash equivalent and investment levels.\n\nWhat Weighs on Bio-Rad?\n\nWeakness in End Markets: The company continues to be negatively affected by the ongoing challenges impacting the biopharma market and small biotech companies. In early 2025, the U.S. government proposed reductions of federal funding to some institutions and companies that are part of Bio-Rad’s customer base. Although there have been signals of improvement, customers are still cautious about the funding environment and conservative in allocating capital. Added to this, large pharmaceutical companies are implementing cost-saving measures through corporate restructuring and R&D reprioritization. In the second quarter of 2025, revenues in the core Life Science Group fell 1.7% year over year and 2.7% on a currency-neutral basis,\n\nTough Competitive Pressure: Bio-Rad operates in a highly competitive environment dominated by firms varying from large multinational corporations with significant resources to start-ups. Also, the competitive and regulatory conditions in the markets where the company operates limit its ability to switch to strategies like price increases and other drivers of cost increases. Further, the extension of the public tender commitments to multiple years by the government, resulting in a reduced number of annual tenders, has led to aggressive tender pricing by Bio-Rad’s competitors.\n\nBIO Stock Estimate Trends\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for Bio-Rad’s 2025 earnings per share (EPS) has increased 5% to $9.69 in the past 30 days.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s 2025 revenues is pegged at $2.58 billion, which indicates a modest 0.6% rise from the year-ago reported number.\n\nKey MedTech Picks\n\nSome better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are Envista NVST, Masimo MASI and Phibro Animal Health PAHC.\n\nEnvista has an estimated earnings growth rate of 15.2% for fiscal 2026 compared with the S&P 500 composite’s 11.7% growth. Shares of the company have rallied 16% compared with the industry’s 3.4% rise. NVST’s earnings surpassed estimates in each of the trailing four quarters, with the average surprise being 16.50%.\n\nNVST carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) at present. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nMasimo, carrying a Zacks Rank #2, has an estimated long-term earnings growth rate of 12.5% compared with the industry’s 9.9%. Its earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters, with the average surprise being 9.17%. MASI shares have rallied 18.9% against the industry’s 15.4% fall in the past year.\n\nPhibro Animal Health, carrying a Zacks Rank #2, has an earnings yield of 6.3% against the industry’s -0.3%. Shares of the company have surged 76.5% compared with the industry’s 3.4% growth.

            "title": "ABT Stock Gains From Navitor's Expanded Indication Approval in Europe",
            "content": "Abbott Laboratories ABT recently received CE Mark in Europe for an expanded indication for its Navitor transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) system to treat people with symptomatic, severe aortic stenosis who are at low or intermediate risk for open-heart surgery. This approval expands Navitor TAVI system’s accessibility, covering patients across all surgical risk categories.\n\nThe approval is expected to bolster the company’s Structural Heart business.\n\nABT Stock’s Likely Trend Following the News\n\nFollowing the announcement, Abbott’s shares edged up 1%, finishing at $132.66 on last Friday.\n\nAbbott’s Structural Heart business continues to drive growth through expanding global adoption and new product launches addressing unmet clinical needs in complex structural heart interventions. Navitor TAVI system is a strong example of how the company continues to evolve its structural heart portfolio to meet the growing demand for minimally invasive alternatives to open-heart surgery. Hence, we expect the market sentiment toward ABT stock to remain positive surrounding the latest expanded indication approval for Navitor.\n\nAbbott holds a market capitalization of $230.89 billion. The company’s earnings yield of 3.9% surpasses the industry’s -0.3%. ABT delivered an average earnings beat of 0.9% in the trailing four quarters.\n\nAbout ABT’s Navitor TAVI System\n\nAortic stenosis occurs when the aortic valve's opening narrows, restricting blood flow to the body. If left untreated, it can lead to heart failure and death. The Navitor TAVI system replaces the aortic valve through a minimally invasive procedure and is delivered to the heart through a small incision in the leg.\n\nAbbott previously received CE Mark approval in Europe and U.S. FDA approval for Navitor to treat patients with symptomatic, severe aortic stenosis who are at high or extreme surgical risk.\n\nProven Clinical Efficacy of ABT’s Navitor TAVI System\n\nThe expanded indication for the Navitor TAVI system was supported by favorable safety and effectiveness data from the VANTAGE trial presented at the European Society of Cardiology Congress 2025 and simultaneously published in JACC: Cardiovascular Interventions.\n\nFindings from the trial include a low rate of all-cause mortality or fatal stroke/stroke with disability and a high rate of technical success with no procedural deaths. The trial found that no patient at 30 days had moderate or greater PVL (paravalvular leak or backflow of blood around the valve), and only 13.6% had mild PVL, a rate that is considered low. Also, excellent hemodynamic performance was seen at 12 months.\n\nStory Continues\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nIndustry Prospects Favor ABT\n\nPer an Allied Market Research report, the global TAVI market is estimated to reach $16.94 billion by 2030, at a CAGR of 14% from 2021 to 2030. Growth of the market is majorly driven by an increase in the prevalence of aortic stenosis, rise in awareness regarding early diagnosis, and advancements in technologies. In addition, a rise in the geriatric population fuels the TAVI market growth, because aged individuals are more susceptible to aortic stenosis.\n\nAnother Development by ABT\n\nLast Monday, Abbott received CE Mark in Europe for the Esprit BTK Everolimus Eluting Resorbable Scaffold System — a breakthrough innovation for people with peripheral artery disease (PAD) below the knee (BTK). The Esprit BTK System is designed to keep arteries open while delivering a drug called everolimus to support vessel healing, before gradually dissolving over time.\n\nABT Stock Price Performance\n\nOver the past year, Abbott’s shares have risen 17.1%, surpassing the industry’s 3.3% growth.\n\nABT’s Zacks Rank and Key Picks\n\nAbbott currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).\n\nSome better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are Envista NVST, Medpace MEDP and Phibro Animal Health PAHC. Envista, Medpace and Phibro carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) each at present. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nShares of Envista have rallied 16.7% in the past year compared with the industry’s 5.2% growth.

            "content": "Healthcare companies are pushing the status quo by innovating in areas like drug development and digital health. But financial performance has lagged recently as players offloaded surplus COVID inventories in 2023 and 2024, a headwind for overall demand. The result? Over the past six months, the industry’s return was flat while the S&P 500 climbed by 10.5%.\n\nDespite the lackluster result, a few diamonds in the rough can produce earnings growth no matter what, and we started StockStory to help you find them. On that note, here is one healthcare stock boasting a durable advantage and two we’re passing on.\n\nTwo Healthcare Stocks to Sell:\n\nEnvista (NVST)\n\nMarket Cap: $3.52 billion\n\nUniting more than 30 trusted brands including Nobel Biocare, Ormco, and DEXIS under one corporate umbrella, Envista Holdings (NYSE:NVST) is a global dental products company that provides equipment, consumables, and specialized technologies for dental professionals.\n\nWhy Do We Avoid NVST?\n\nWeak constant currency growth over the past two years indicates challenges in maintaining its market share Push for growth has led to negative returns on capital, signaling value destruction, and its shrinking returns suggest its past profit sources are losing steam Eroding returns on capital from an already low base indicate that management’s recent investments are destroying value\n\nEnvista is trading at $21.18 per share, or 18.9x forward P/E. If you’re considering NVST for your portfolio, see our FREE research report to learn more.\n\nSurgery Partners (SGRY)\n\nMarket Cap: $2.89 billion\n\nWith more than 180 locations across 33 states serving as alternatives to traditional hospital settings, Surgery Partners (NASDAQ:SGRY) operates a national network of outpatient surgical facilities including ambulatory surgery centers and short-stay surgical hospitals.\n\nWhy Does SGRY Give Us Pause?\n\nUnderwhelming unit sales over the past two years suggest it might have to lower prices to accelerate growth Ability to fund investments or reward shareholders with increased buybacks or dividends is restricted by its weak free cash flow margin of 4.3% for the last five years 6× net-debt-to-EBITDA ratio makes lenders less willing to extend additional capital, potentially necessitating dilutive equity offerings\n\nSurgery Partners’s stock price of $22.69 implies a valuation ratio of 23.8x forward P/E. Check out our free in-depth research report to learn more about why SGRY doesn’t pass our bar.\n\nOne Healthcare Stock to Watch:\n\nCardinal Health (CAH)\n\nMarket Cap: $35.53 billion\n\nOperating as a critical link in the healthcare supply chain since 1979, Cardinal Health (NYSE:CAH) distributes pharmaceuticals and manufactures medical products for hospitals, pharmacies, and healthcare providers across the global healthcare supply chain.\n\nStory Continues\n\nWhy Could CAH Be a Winner?\n\nEnormous revenue base of $222.6 billion gives it economies of scale and advantages over new entrants due to the industry’s regulatory complexity Demand will likely accelerate over the next 12 months as its forecasted revenue growth of 11.9% is above its two-year trend Earnings per share have outperformed the peer group average over the last five years, increasing by 8.6% annually\n\nAt $147.39 per share, Cardinal Health trades at 16.1x forward P/E.

            "title": "Envista (NVST) Upgraded to Strong Buy: Here's Why",
            "content": "Envista (NVST) appears an attractive pick, as it has been recently upgraded to a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). This upgrade is essentially a reflection of an upward trend in earnings estimates -- one of the most powerful forces impacting stock prices.\n\nThe sole determinant of the Zacks rating is a company's changing earnings picture. The Zacks Consensus Estimate -- the consensus of EPS estimates from the sell-side analysts covering the stock -- for the current and following years is tracked by the system.\n\nThe power of a changing earnings picture in determining near-term stock price movements makes the Zacks rating system highly useful for individual investors, since it can be difficult to make decisions based on rating upgrades by Wall Street analysts. These are mostly driven by subjective factors that are hard to see and measure in real time.\n\nAs such, the Zacks rating upgrade for Envista is essentially a positive comment on its earnings outlook that could have a favorable impact on its stock price.\n\nMost Powerful Force Impacting Stock Prices\n\nThe change in a company's future earnings potential, as reflected in earnings estimate revisions, has proven to be strongly correlated with the near-term price movement of its stock. The influence of institutional investors has a partial contribution to this relationship, as these big professionals use earnings and earnings estimates to calculate the fair value of a company's shares. An increase or decrease in earnings estimates in their valuation models simply results in higher or lower fair value for a stock, and institutional investors typically buy or sell it. Their transaction of large amounts of shares then leads to price movement for the stock.\n\nFundamentally speaking, rising earnings estimates and the consequent rating upgrade for Envista imply an improvement in the company's underlying business. Investors should show their appreciation for this improving business trend by pushing the stock higher.\n\nHarnessing the Power of Earnings Estimate Revisions\n\nEmpirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock movements, so it could be truly rewarding if such revisions are tracked for making an investment decision. Here is where the tried-and-tested Zacks Rank stock-rating system plays an important role, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions.\n\nThe Zacks Rank stock-rating system, which uses four factors related to earnings estimates to classify stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive externally-audited track record, with Zacks Rank #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>> .\n\nStory Continues\n\nEarnings Estimate Revisions for Envista\n\nFor the fiscal year ending December 2025, this maker of dental products is expected to earn $1.12 per share, which is unchanged compared with the year-ago reported number.\n\nAnalysts have been steadily raising their estimates for Envista. Over the past three months, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company has increased 7.9%.\n\nBottom Line\n\nUnlike the overly optimistic Wall Street analysts whose rating systems tend to be weighted toward favorable recommendations, the Zacks rating system maintains an equal proportion of \"buy\" and \"sell\" ratings for its entire universe of more than 4,000 stocks at any point in time. Irrespective of market conditions, only the top 5% of the Zacks-covered stocks get a \"Strong Buy\" rating and the next 15% get a \"Buy\" rating. So, the placement of a stock in the top 20% of the Zacks-covered stocks indicates its superior earnings estimate revision feature, making it a solid candidate for producing market-beating returns in the near term.\n\nYou can learn more about the Zacks Rank here >>>\n\nThe upgrade of Envista to a Zacks Rank #1 positions it in the top 5% of the Zacks-covered stocks in terms of estimate revisions, implying that the stock might move higher in the near term.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

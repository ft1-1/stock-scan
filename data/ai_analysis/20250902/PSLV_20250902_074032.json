Nevertheless, the upside for gold above $3,400 is looking increasingly limited,\" Commerzbank wrote.\n\nFront-month Comex gold (XAUUSD:CUR [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/XAUUSD:CUR]) for September delivery ended +1.2% to $3,473.70/oz, a new record close, capping gains of 2.8% this week and 5.5% in August for the metal's best one-month net and percentage gain since April, while the most-active December contract finished +1.2% on Friday and 3% for the week at $3,516.10/oz.\n\nComex silver (XAGUSD:CUR [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/XAGUSD:CUR]) continued its strong showing, with the front-month September contract closing +2.6% $40.20/oz, its highest settlement value since September 21, 2011, up 2.9% this week and 10% for August for an eighth straight monthly increase.\n\nETFs: (NYSEARCA:GLD [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GLD]), (NYSEARCA:GDX [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GDX]), (GDXJ [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GDXJ]), (NYSEARCA:IAU [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/IAU]), (NYSEARCA:NUGT [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NUGT]), (PHYS [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/PHYS]), (GLDM [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GLDM]), (AAAU [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AAAU]), (SGOL [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SGOL]), (RING [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/RING]), (BAR [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BAR]), (OUNZ [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/OUNZ]), (SLV [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SLV]), (PSLV [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/PSLV]), (SIVR [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SIVR]), (SIL [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SIL]), (SILJ [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SILJ])\n\nMORE ON GOLD AND GOLD MINERS\n\n \t* Who's In Charge Of The U.S. Economy (If Not The Fed)?

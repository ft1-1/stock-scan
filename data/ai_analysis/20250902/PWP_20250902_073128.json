            "title": "Perella Weinberg Partners (NASDAQ:PWP) Presents a High-Quality Technical Breakout Setup",
            "content": "Perella Weinberg Partners (NASDAQ:PWP [https://www.chartmill.com/stock/quote/PWP]) has become a significant choice for technical investors after a systematic screening process made to find high-quality breakout setups. This method uses two specific metrics from ChartMill, the Technical Rating and the Setup Quality Rating, to find stocks that are not only in good technical condition but also moving in a way that indicates a likely upward move. The process highlights the value of choosing equities that show both trend power and a clear entry point, lowering risk while increasing possible gain during breakout periods.\n\n[PWP Stock Chart]\n\nTECHNICAL STRENGTH: A BASE FOR CONFIDENCE\nThe base of any good breakout candidate is its basic technical strength, and PWP does very well here with a Technical Rating of 9 out of 10. This score shows solid performance across various timeframes and technical indicators. Both short-term and long-term trends are positive, showing continued buying interest and momentum. The stock is trading above important moving averages, including the 20-day, 50-day, and 100-day SMAs, all of which are moving up, a typical sign of a good uptrend. Also, PWP shows good relative strength, doing better than 74% of stocks in the Capital Markets industry and 80% of all stocks in the market over the last year. This mix of trend alignment, moving average support, and relative outperformance gives a solid technical background, necessary for reducing false breakouts and making sure the stock is in a good position for further progress.\n\nSETUP QUALITY: FINDING THE BEST ENTRY ZONE\nWhile technical strength finds _which_ stock to look at, the Setup Quality Rating deals with _when_ to act, and PWP also does very well here with a score of 9. This high rating indicates that the stock is in a consolidation phase, marked by lower volatility and price action held within a set range, in this case, between about $20.79 and $22.95 over the last month. This kind of consolidation is important because it allows for finding clear support and resistance levels, making exact entry and exit points possible. Currently, PWP is trading near the top of this range, close to a resistance zone between $22.40 and $22.83. A breakout above this zone could show the next upward move. The setup is made stronger by the existence of several support levels below, especially near $22.06, which gives a sensible area for a stop-loss order, therefore handling risk well. The recent appearance of a Pocket Pivot signal, a volume-backed price move showing accumulation, gives more support to the chance for an upward breakout.\n\nSTRATEGIC MEANING AND RISK MANAGEMENT\nFor technical traders, the combination of a high Technical Rating and a high Setup Quality Rating in PWP shows a notable opportunity. The solid technical base suggests the stock is in a confirmed uptrend with institutional support, while the tight consolidation pattern gives a good risk/reward setup. A suggested plan involves placing a buy-stop order just above the resistance zone, around $22.84, to confirm momentum, along with a stop-loss order below the closest support near $21.55. This caps the possible loss to about 5.65% on the trade, a controllable risk considering the upside chance. It is important to note that while the wider market, as shown by the S&P 500, is also in a positive trend, PWP’s own technical and setup metrics are the main reasons for this opportunity, highlighting the value of security-specific analysis.\n\nFor investors wanting to look into similar technical breakout chances, other choices can be seen using the Technical Breakout Setups screen [https://www.chartmill.com/stock/stock-screener?sid=202&f=v1_50b500,atrpct_a_1,sl_ta_7_X,sl_se_7_X,p_pg20&s=se&v=3&timeframe=WEEKLY&o1=3&op1=200,16711680&o2=3&op2=50,255&o3=1] on ChartMill, which looks for stocks showing high ratings in both technical condition and setup quality.\n\n_Disclaimer: This article is for informational purposes only and does not constitute investment advice.

            "content": "Looking at the universe of stocks we cover at Dividend Channel, on 8/29/25, Perella Weinberg Partners - Class A (Symbol: PWP), P10 Inc Class A (Symbol: PX), and RLI Corp (Symbol: RLI) will all trade ex-dividend for their respective upcoming dividends.  Perella Weinberg Partners - Class A will pay its quarterly dividend of $0.07 on 9/10/25, P10 Inc Class A will pay its quarterly dividend of $0.0375 on 9/19/25, and RLI Corp will pay its quarterly dividend of $0.16 on 9/19/25. As a percentage of PWP's recent stock price of $22.67, this dividend works out to approximately 0.31%, so look for shares of Perella Weinberg Partners - Class A to trade 0.31% lower — all else being equal — when PWP shares open for trading on 8/29/25.  Similarly, investors should look for PX to open 0.30% lower in price and for RLI to open 0.24% lower, all else being equal.\n\nBelow are dividend history charts for PWP, PX, and RLI, showing historical dividends prior to the most recent ones declared.\n\nPerella Weinberg Partners - Class A (Symbol: PWP):\n\nP10 Inc Class A (Symbol: PX):\n\nRLI Corp (Symbol: RLI):\n\nIn general, dividends are not always predictable, following the ups and downs of company profits over time.  Therefore, a good first due diligence step in forming an expectation of annual yield going forward, is looking at the history above, for a sense of stability over time.  This can help in judging whether the most recent dividends from these companies are likely to continue.  If they do continue, the current estimated yields on annualized basis would be 1.24% for Perella Weinberg Partners - Class A, 1.20% for P10 Inc Class A, and 0.95% for RLI Corp.\n\nIn Wednesday trading, Perella Weinberg Partners - Class A shares are currently up about 4.3%, P10 Inc Class A shares are off about 0.3%, and RLI Corp shares are down about 0.2% on the day.\n\nClick here to learn which 25 S.A.F.E. dividend stocks should be on your radar screen »\n\nAlso see:\n\n Energy Stocks Hedge Funds Are Selling\r\n  Top Ten Hedge Funds Holding BAFN\r\n  IBOT Options Chain </p>\n\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.",

            "content": "Stocks in the $10-50 range offer a sweet spot between affordability and stability as they’re typically more established than penny stocks. But their headline prices don’t guarantee quality, and investors should exercise caution as some have shaky business models.\n\nThese dynamics can cause headaches for even the most seasoned professionals, which is why we started StockStory - to help you separate the good companies from the bad. That said, here are three stocks under $50 to swipe left on and some alternatives you should look into instead.\n\nUiPath (PATH)\n\nShare Price: $11.14\n\nStarting with robotic process automation (RPA) and evolving into a comprehensive automation powerhouse, UiPath (NYSE:PATH) provides an AI-powered business automation platform that enables organizations to create software robots that mimic human actions to streamline repetitive tasks and processes.\n\nWhy Does PATH Fall Short?\n\nProducts, pricing, or go-to-market strategy may need some adjustments as its 4.2% average billings growth over the last year was weak Customer acquisition costs take a while to recoup, making it difficult to justify sales and marketing investments that could increase revenue Historical operating margin losses point to an inefficient cost structure\n\nUiPath is trading at $11.14 per share, or 3.9x forward price-to-sales. To fully understand why you should be careful with PATH, check out our full research report (it’s free).\n\nPediatrix Medical Group (MD)\n\nShare Price: $17.01\n\nWith a network of approximately 2,620 affiliated physicians caring for some of the most vulnerable patients, Pediatrix Medical Group (NYSE:MD) provides specialized physician services focused on neonatal, maternal-fetal, pediatric cardiology and other pediatric subspecialty care across 37 states.\n\nWhy Is MD Risky?\n\nDisappointing comparable store sales over the past two years show customers aren’t responding well to its offerings and value proposition Sales are expected to decline once again over the next 12 months as it continues working through a challenging demand environment Shrinking returns on capital from an already weak position reveal that neither previous nor ongoing investments are yielding the desired results\n\nAt $17.01 per share, Pediatrix Medical Group trades at 10.3x forward P/E. Check out our free in-depth research report to learn more about why MD doesn’t pass our bar.\n\nPerella Weinberg (PWP)\n\nShare Price: $22.40\n\nFounded in 2006 by veteran investment bankers Joseph Perella and Peter Weinberg during a wave of boutique advisory firm launches, Perella Weinberg Partners (NASDAQ:PWP) is a global independent advisory firm that provides strategic and financial advice to corporations, financial sponsors, and government institutions.\n\nStory Continues\n\nWhy Does PWP Give Us Pause?\n\nFlat earnings per share over the last three years lagged its peers Negative return on equity shows that some of its growth strategies have backfired\n\nPerella Weinberg’s stock price of $22.40 implies a valuation ratio of 16.4x forward P/E. Dive into our free research report to see why there are better opportunities than PWP.\n\nHigh-Quality Stocks for All Market Conditions\n\nTrump’s April 2025 tariff bombshell triggered a massive market selloff, but stocks have since staged an impressive recovery, leaving those who panic sold on the sidelines.\n\nTake advantage of the rebound by checking out our Top 5 Growth Stocks for this month. This is a curated list of our High Quality stocks that have generated a market-beating return of 183% over the last five years (as of March 31st 2025).\n\nStocks that made our list in 2020 include now familiar names such as Nvidia (+1,545% between March 2020 and March 2025) as well as under-the-radar businesses like the once-micro-cap company Kadant (+351% five-year return).

            "content": "Key Insights\n\nRigetti Computing's significant individual investors ownership suggests that the key decisions are influenced by shareholders from the larger public A total of 25 investors have a majority stake in the company with 35% ownership Insiders have sold recently\n\nWe've found 21 US stocks that are forecast to pay a dividend yield of over 6% next year. See the full list for free.\n\nEvery investor in Rigetti Computing, Inc. (NASDAQ:RGTI) should be aware of the most powerful shareholder groups. We can see that individual investors own the lion's share in the company with 58% ownership. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).\n\nIndividual investors gained the most after market cap touched US$5.3b last week, while institutions who own 40% also benefitted.\n\nLet's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about Rigetti Computing.\n\nSee our latest analysis for Rigetti Computing NasdaqCM:RGTI Ownership Breakdown September 1st 2025\n\nWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Rigetti Computing?\n\nInstitutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.\n\nAs you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Rigetti Computing. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of Rigetti Computing, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too.NasdaqCM:RGTI Earnings and Revenue Growth September 1st 2025\n\nHedge funds don't have many shares in Rigetti Computing. Our data shows that The Vanguard Group, Inc. is the largest shareholder with 7.0% of shares outstanding. In comparison, the second and third largest shareholders hold about 6.5% and 2.7% of the stock.\n\nA deeper look at our ownership data shows that the top 25 shareholders collectively hold less than half of the register, suggesting a large group of small holders where no single shareholder has a majority.\n\nWhile studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.\n\nStory Continues\n\nInsider Ownership Of Rigetti Computing\n\nWhile the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.\n\nMost consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.\n\nOur most recent data indicates that insiders own less than 1% of Rigetti Computing, Inc.. We do note, however, it is possible insiders have an indirect interest through a private company or other corporate structure. It's a big company, so even a small proportional interest can create alignment between the board and shareholders. In this case insiders own US$37m worth of shares. It is always good to see at least some insider ownership, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been selling.\n\nGeneral Public Ownership\n\nThe general public -- including retail investors -- own 58% of Rigetti Computing. This size of ownership gives investors from the general public some collective power. They can and probably do influence decisions on executive compensation, dividend policies and proposed business acquisitions.\n\nNext Steps:\n\nIt's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand Rigetti Computing better, we need to consider many other factors. Be aware that  Rigetti Computing is showing  4 warning signs in our investment analysis, and 1 of those can't be ignored...\n\nIf you are like me, you may want to think about whether this company will grow or shrink.

Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now. Continue »\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nTechnical breakthroughs mask commercial struggles\n\nIn August 2025, Rigetti's modular 36-qubit system -- four 9-qubit chiplets linked together -- achieved 99.5% median two-qubit gate fidelity, halving errors from its Ankaa-3 machine. A 100-plus qubit chiplet system is targeted by year-end. Think of it like building a supercomputer from many processors instead of one impossible monolith.\n\nRigetti's superconducting qubits operate at fractions of a degree above absolute zero. The company's two-qubit gates run in tens of nanoseconds, versus tens of microseconds for trapped-ion or neutral-atom systems -- roughly 100 to 1,000 times faster. Faster gates allow more operations within limited coherence times, though rival platforms often deliver higher fidelities and longer lifetimes.\n\nOn the financial front, second-quarter 2025 revenue fell to $1.8 million from $3.1 million a year ago, reflecting contract timing. Income comes from cloud access, custom algorithm work, and government research and development (R&D). Operating losses of $19.9 million in the most recent quarter underscore the capital-intensive nature of this nascent field.\n\nIn short, technical progress is ramping while revenues remain minimal.\n\nGovernment validation provides crucial backing\n\nDARPA tapped Rigetti as a performer in its Quantum Benchmarking Initiative -- a program seeking \"utility-scale\" quantum computers by 2033 -- alongside IBM and IonQ. The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's (DARPA) track record includes the internet, GPS, and stealth aircraft, making its backing a meaningful vote of confidence.\n\nMeanwhile, Washington is advancing the National Quantum Initiative (NQI) Reauthorization Act (approximately $2.7 billion) and the Department of Energy Quantum Leadership Act (approximately $2.5 billion).

The bottom line is that global governments are racing to fund credible players in this emerging space.\n\nHow does Rigetti fit into this government-backed innovation bonanza? Rigetti manufactures at its Fab-1 facility using semiconductor-style modular methods. By wiring smaller chips into larger systems, it sidesteps yield issues that plagued single-chip designs. IBM's 1,121-qubit Condor processor (2023) underscored the limits of monolithic scaling and pushed IBM itself toward modular architectures.\n\nPut simply, Rigetti was ahead of the curve in employing modular designs -- a critical decision that could translate into a key competitive advantage.\n\nExtreme valuation demands caution\n\nRigetti raised $350 million in Q2 via an at-the-market program, ending the quarter with $571.6 million in cash and no debt. That buys time through 2026, but the opportunistic raise at lofty prices signals management's awareness that current valuations may not last.\n\nAt a $5.3 billion market cap on approximately $11 million-ish in trailing revenue, Rigetti stock trades at around 495 times sales. By comparison, traditional semiconductor giant Nvidia trades at approximately 40 times forward earnings -- with profits, proven demand, and a rock-solid moat. While rich, Nvidia's premium pales in comparison to those of Rigetti and other pure-play quantum stocks, all of which are cash-flow negative at the moment.\n\nA speculative bet on computing's future\n\nQuantum computing could be the next revolution -- or an expensive science experiment. Rigetti's 36-qubit milestone and DARPA backing validate its chiplet strategy, and $571.6 million in cash provides breathing room.\n\nStill, at 495 times trailing sales, the stock's valuation prices in perfection. Thus, risk-tolerant investors might cap exposure at no more than 2% of a well-diversified portfolio.

            "content": "Key Points\n\nThe quantum computer sector is hot, helping to propel Rigetti Computing's shares by more than 1,500% in the past year. The company unveiled a powerful quantum computer that puts Rigetti a step closer to achieving quantum advantage. Rigetti faces declining revenue and rising costs, but exited Q2 with substantial cash and investment reserves of over $570 million and no debt. 10 stocks we like better than Rigetti Computing ›\n\nRigetti Computing(NASDAQ: RGTI) is among the stocks benefiting from investor interest in the quantum computing field. The company's shares are up over 1,500% in the past 12 months through Aug. 27.\n\nRigetti and other businesses in the sector are developing technology with the potential to transform industries, including medicine and artificial intelligence. Because quantum computers are powered by atomic particles, they boast computational capabilities beyond the reach of current classical computers.\n\nHowever, they also have shortcomings that hinder their widespread adoption. One key drawback is that errors creep into quantum computations due to the extreme difficulty of isolating and controlling quantum states. While quantum computing is inherently probabilistic (which is actually useful for many algorithms that rely on randomness), the real challenge is that environmental noise and imperfect controls corrupt these probabilities. Finding and correcting these errors -- distinguishing between intended quantum randomness and unwanted noise -- is one of the field's key issues.\n\nCan Rigetti's tech overcome such challenges? Discovering the answer requires diving into the company in more detail.Image source: Getty Images.\n\nRigetti's technological prowess\n\nRigetti's technology employs superconducting qubits, a widely used approach to quantum computing due to its advantages. This method performs faster than other quantum techniques and leverages existing semiconductor chip fabrication processes, which helps to scale up the technology.\n\nIn recent weeks, Rigetti unveiled its latest invention, the Cepheus-1-36Q. This multi-chip quantum machine is the largest in the industry, according to the company. Moreover, the device's calculation error rate is half that of its predecessor.\n\nThe Cepheus-1-36Q shows Rigetti is making progress toward overcoming the issues inherent in quantum computers. Despite that, the company isn't growing sales this year. In the second quarter, Rigetti generated $1.8 million in revenue, which was down from $3.1 million in 2024.\n\nA look into Rigetti's financials\n\nWhile the company has struggled to produce revenue, its costs are climbing. Rigetti's Q2 cost of revenue and operating expenses both ticked up from 2024, resulting in an operating loss of $19.9 million versus a loss of $16.1 million in the previous year.\n\nStory Continues\n\nThe costly combination of rising expenses and declining sales is cause for concern. Rigetti's saving grace is that it amassed an impressive $571.6 million in cash, cash equivalents, and available-for-sale investments with no debt on its balance sheet. The funds can sustain operations in the short term as the company builds up income.\n\nThe quest to increase sales relies on how quickly Rigetti's tech can achieve quantum advantage. This is the point at which a quantum device can solve useful, real-world problems more effectively than classical computers.\n\nAccording to CEO Dr. Subodh Kulkarni, Rigetti is about four years away from achieving quantum advantage. In the meantime, it's cobbling revenue together from organizations interested in quantum computing for research and experimentation, such as its collaboration with Montana State University announced on Aug. 20.\n\nFactors to consider before deciding on Rigetti stock\n\nAt this early stage in quantum computing's development, Rigetti's future depends on reaching quantum advantage as fast as possible. Once there, it can unlock more sales as its technology becomes a superior alternative to classical supercomputers.\n\nCan Rigetti achieve this goal in four years? Its shares are trading as if that's likely.\n\nHere's a look at the stock's valuation using the price-to-sales (P/S) ratio, and contrasting it to other pure-play quantum computing competitors IonQ and D-Wave Quantum. This metric measures how much investors are willing to pay for every dollar of revenue generated over the trailing 12 months.Data by YCharts.\n\nRigetti's P/S multiple is sky-high compared to its rivals, indicating that shares are expensive. Perhaps investors are betting the company can achieve quantum advantage.\n\nBut a lot can happen in four years, and if Rigetti continues to burn through cash with little revenue trickling in, the business may not survive to achieve its goal.\n\nIn addition, many well-heeled competitors, including Alphabet-owned Google, are actively pursuing quantum advantage. Google has already developed a quantum chip capable of completing a complex computation in five minutes that would take centuries with today's fastest supercomputers. Granted, this algorithm is a benchmark designed to be easy for quantum computers and hard for digital system, but it's still an impressive achievement.\n\nAlthough it's too early to tell which business will deliver the dominant technology, one or more of these rivals could build a scalable quantum computer that overcomes the obstacles to broad adoption. This competition impacts Rigetti's ability to attract customers, as evidenced by its difficulties with revenue growth.\n\nConsequently, only investors with a high risk tolerance should consider buying Rigetti shares. Even then, given its stock's inflated valuation, the ideal approach is to wait for the share price to drop before deciding to invest.\n\nShould you buy stock in Rigetti Computing right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Rigetti Computing, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Rigetti Computing wasn’t one of them.

            "content": "The directors of a company tend to have a unique inside view into the business, so when directors make major buys, investors are wise to take notice.  Presumably the only reason a director of a company would choose to take their hard-earned cash and use it to buy stock in the open market, is that they expect to make money — maybe they find the stock very undervalued, or maybe they see exciting progress within the company, or maybe both.  So in this series we look at the largest insider buys by company directors over the trailing six month period, one of which was a total of $240.4K invested across 2 purchases by John R. Haley, Director at Sonoco Products Co. (Symbol: SON).  PurchasedInsiderTitleSharesPrice/ShareValue02/27/2025John R. HaleyDirector3,000$46.76$140,269.8005/02/2025John R. HaleyDirector2,246$44.57$100,100.18\n\nHaley's average cost works out to $45.82/share.  Shares of Sonoco Products Co. were changing hands at $46.62 at last check, trading down about 0.5% on Thursday.  The chart below shows the one year performance of SON shares, versus its 200 day moving average:\n\nLooking at the chart above, SON's low point in its 52 week range is $39.46 per share, with $56.77 as the 52 week high point — that compares with a last trade of $46.62.\n\nThe current annualized dividend paid by Sonoco Products Co. is $2.12/share, currently paid in quarterly installments, and its most recent dividend ex-date was on 08/08/2025.  Below is a long-term dividend history chart for SON, which can be of good help in judging whether the most recent dividend with approx. 4.5% annualized yield is likely to continue.\n\nClick here to find out which other top insider buys by company directors you need to know about »\n\nAlso see:\n\n ETF Finder\r\n  Top Ten Hedge Funds Holding LNGR\r\n  Top Ten Hedge Funds Holding ABCB </p>\n\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.",

            "title": "Silgan, International Paper upgraded at Bank of America on valuation, pricing",
            "content": "[Cartons waiting to be loaded into containers,There are a lot of leftover products.3d rendering]\nOselote/iStock via Getty Images\n\nBank of America Securities on Thursday raised its ratings on Silgan Holdings (NYSE:SLGN [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SLGN]) and International Paper (NYSE:IP [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/IP]) to Buy from Neutral, citing attractive valuations and stronger-than-expected containerboard pricing that could offset operational headwinds.\n\nThe call follows a volatile second-quarter earnings season, in which packaging and paperboard stocks fell about 5% since June 30, underperforming the Standard & Poor’s 500 stock index (SP500 [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SP500]). Analyst George Staphos said recent price action has created opportunities in the sector as investors cautiously shift back to a more “risk-on” posture.\n\nSILGAN: PULLBACK CREATES ENTRY POINT\n\nSilgan (NYSE:SLGN [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SLGN]) shares dropped more than 15% after the company lowered earnings guidance, citing weak beverage closure volumes and a food-can customer bankruptcy. Staphos argued the sell-off was overdone, given the company now trades at roughly 11 to 12 times forward earnings, below peers that average closer to 14 times.\n\nWhile defensive elements remain because of food cans, the analysts said they believe the downside is priced in and they see room for volumes to improve. Bank of America also highlighted upside for other packaging names, including Sealed Air (SEE [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SEE]), Sonoco Products (SON [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SON]) and Graphic Packaging Holding (GPK [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GPK]).\n\nINTERNATIONAL PAPER: PRICING OFFSETS EXECUTION RISK\n\nFor International Paper (NYSE:IP [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/IP]), Bank of America acknowledged ongoing execution risk following its pulp divestiture and restructuring efforts. Still, the firm sees pricing power as a decisive factor. The bank lifted its 2026 forecasts, adding another $40 per ton increase in the third quarter of 2026 on top of an earlier $40 per ton bump for the first quarter. Its projected $60 per ton rise is well above consensus estimates of $20 to $30, according to Visible Alpha data cited by the bank.\n\nOperating rates should exceed 95% by 2026, and if the bank’s pricing assumptions hold, that will more than offset near-term operational challenges, Staphos said. Packaging Corp. of America (PKG [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/PKG]), already rated Buy, stands to benefit even more directly given its cleaner profile without restructuring complications.\n\nSECTOR STILL ACTS LIKE ‘BONDS IN DISGUISE’\n\nDespite pricing momentum, Bank of America cautioned that aggregate volume growth in packaging remains sluggish, averaging just 1% to 3% since the sector’s recession ended in late 2023. Staphos reiterated his longstanding view that packaging stocks often behave “like bonds masquerading as equities,” delivering strong cash flows but limited growth. Value creation, he added, depends on disciplined capital allocation and shareholder returns, rather than large-scale acquisitions unless tied to commercial gains.\n\nWith the upgrades, Bank of America now holds Buy ratings across all three containerboard producers it covers: International Paper (IP [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/IP]), Packaging Corp. of America (PKG [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/PKG]) and WestRock rival Graphic Packaging (GPK [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GPK]). The ratings reflect a more optimistic stance on sector fundamentals heading into 2026.\n\nMORE ON SILGAN HOLDINGS, INTERNATIONAL PAPER\n\n \t* International Paper Company 2025 Q2 - Results - Earnings Call Presentation [https://seekingalpha.com/article/4807091-international-paper-company-2025-q2-results-earnings-call-presentation]\n \t* International Paper Company (IP) Q2 2025 Earnings Call Transcript [https://seekingalpha.com/article/4807090-international-paper-company-ip-q2-2025-earnings-call-transcript]\n \t* Silgan Holdings Inc. 2025 Q2 - Results - Earnings Call Presentation [https://seekingalpha.com/article/4806352-silgan-holdings-inc-2025-q2-results-earnings-call-presentation]\n \t* American Industrial Partners to acquire International Paper's Global Cellulose Fibers Division [https://seekingalpha.com/news/4487923-american-industrial-partners-to-acquire-international-papers-global-cellulose-fibers-division]\n \t* International Paper outlines $6B EBITDA target by 2027 as transformation momentum builds [https://seekingalpha.com/news/4475987-international-paper-outlines-6b-ebitda-target-by-2027-as-transformation-momentum-builds]\n\n ",

            "title": "Bullish Sonoco Products Insiders Loaded Up On US$3.33m Of Stock",
            "content": "Over the last year, a good number of insiders have significantly increased their holdings in Sonoco Products Company (NYSE:SON). This is encouraging because it indicates that insiders are more optimistic about the company's prospects.\n\nAlthough we don't think shareholders should simply follow insider transactions, logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares.\n\nTrump has pledged to \"unleash\" American oil and gas and these 15 US stocks have developments that are poised to benefit.\n\nThe Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At Sonoco Products\n\nIn the last twelve months, the biggest single purchase by an insider was when President Robert Coker bought US$930k worth of shares at a price of US$46.48 per share. That implies that an insider found the current price of US$47.55 per share to be enticing. Of course they may have changed their mind. But this suggests they are optimistic. While we always like to see insider buying, it's less meaningful if the purchases were made at much lower prices, as the opportunity they saw may have passed. Happily, the Sonoco Products insiders decided to buy shares at close to current prices.\n\nIn the last twelve months insiders purchased 74.72k shares for US$3.3m. But insiders sold 13.66k shares worth US$699k. Overall, Sonoco Products insiders were net buyers during the last year. You can see the insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year depicted in the chart below.

If investing in lesser known companies is your style, you could take a look at this freelist of companies. (Hint: insiders have been buying them).\n\nDoes Sonoco Products Boast High Insider Ownership?\n\nMany investors like to check how much of a company is owned by insiders. A high insider ownership often makes company leadership more mindful of shareholder interests. Insiders own 1.1% of Sonoco Products shares, worth about US$53m. While this is a strong but not outstanding level of insider ownership, it's enough to indicate some alignment between management and smaller shareholders.\n\nSo What Do The Sonoco Products Insider Transactions Indicate?\n\nThe fact that there have been no Sonoco Products insider transactions recently certainly doesn't bother us. However, our analysis of transactions over the last year is heartening. Insiders do have a stake in Sonoco Products and their transactions don't cause us concern. So while it's helpful to know what insiders are doing in terms of buying or selling, it's also helpful to know the risks that a particular company is facing. Our analysis shows 4 warning signs for Sonoco Products (2 are concerning!) and we strongly recommend you look at these before investing.\n\nStory Continues\n\nIf you would prefer to check out another company -- one with potentially superior financials -- then do not miss this freelist of interesting companies, that have HIGH return on equity and low debt.\n\nFor the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body.

Tablets & Capsules are the fastest growing product form in nutraceutical packaging market during the forecast period, in terms of value. North America accounts the largest share in nutraceutical packaging market in terms of value.\n\nThe firms in the nutraceutical packaging sector are turning to environmentally friendly options like biodegradable and recyclable packaging due to tighter sustainability regulations. Smart packaging, which includes QR codes and NFC labels, keeps track of products by engaging consumers and allows brands to stand out from competitors. Companies like Amcor Inc. are introducing recyclable high-barrier laminates, both providing safety of the product and meeting sustainability objectives. Customized packaging made possible by digital printing is also growing as more shoppers seek personalized health care. The trends emphasize the sectors focus on sustainability, innovation, and meeting customer needs.\n\nStory Continues\n\nThe U.S. nutraceutical packaging industry is growing strongly with increasing demand for dietary supplements and functional foods. The biggest market for nutraceutical packaging is North America, with the U.S. leading it, backed by a well-developed nutraceutical industry and growing consumer awareness towards health and wellness. Increasing awareness of preventive health and natural health supplements has improved demand for special packaging solutions providing product safety, compliance with aggressive regulations, and consumer convenience. Tablets and capsules are among the fastest-growing sectors in dietary supplements because they can be easily consumed and have well-defined dosage levels, requiring packaging protection to retain product stability. Major trends in the U.S. market include the utilization of eco-friendly packaging options, such as biodegradable packaging or recyclable packaging, which aligns with environmental considerations and consumer interests in green products. In addition, high-tech features, such as anti-counterfeiting, intelligent labeling, and customized packaging, become a trend to support product authenticity and enhance engagement with customers. Growth in e-commerce has also led to increased demand for lightweight and robust packaging forms appropriate for internet retailing.\n\nGet Customization on this Report: https://www.marketsandmarkets.com/requestCustomizationNew.asp?id=15284853\n\nBottles are the fastest-growing packaging form in nutraceutical packaging due to their convenience, strength, and ease of use for customers. Bottles are an amazing storage option for powders, granules, and liquids in a way that retains the product effectiveness and adds to shelf life. Bottles are convenient to use, they can be resealed, and they can be designed as child-resistant packaging for functional foods and dietary supplements. Bottles can also be produced using environment-friendly materials like recyclable plastic, which is going to gain greater significance from consumers. And the growth in e-commerce also added to the demand for bottles since they possess the capability of offering strong packaging during shipping. All these make bottles grow incredibly fast in nutraceuticals packaging.\n\nDietary supplements is the fastest growing product type in nutraceutical packaging market. An increase in health-conscious customers is driving demand for supplements related to overall health, immunity, weight control and sports nutrition. Growth is further supplemented by an aging world population which tends to rely on supplements to help address aging-related health issues. The post-pandemic has seen an increase in the use of immunity-related supplements, and this has led to an increase in demand for new and protective packaging. Dietary supplements typically need differentiated packaging to maintain product integrity, safety and efficacy. This has generated new lines of environmentally friendly and sustainable packaging including biodegradable materials and recyclable packaging design. Prospects are in capitalizing on these trends by investing in sustainable materials, intelligent technologies, and solutions country-specific. These prospects can be capitalized upon by business firms through investing in R&D, partnering with regulatory agencies, and increasing their reach in emerging economies to maintain competitive edge.\n\nBrowse Adjacent Markets Packaging Market Research Reports\n\nRelated Reports:\n\nCarbon Nanotubes Market Ceramic Sanitary Ware Market Graphite Market Graphene Market Flexible Packaging Market\n\nCONTACT: About MarketsandMarkets™ MarketsandMarkets™ has been recognized as one of America's Best Management Consulting Firms by Forbes, as per their recent report.

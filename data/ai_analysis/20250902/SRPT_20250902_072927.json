            "title": "SRPT Stock Alert: Investors with Large Losses Should Contact Robbins LLP for Information About the Pending Lead Plaintiff Deadline in the Sarepta Therapeutics, Inc. Class Action",
            "content": "SAN DIEGO, Aug.  29, 2025  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Robbins LLP reminds stockholders that a class action was filed on behalf of investors who purchased or otherwise acquired Sarepta Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ: SRPT) securities between June 22, 2023 and June 24, 2025. Sarepta is a commercial-stage biopharmaceutical company that focuses on RNA and gene therapies for the treatment of rare diseases. During the class period, Sarepta was engaged in the development of therapies to treat Duchenne muscular dystrophy (“Duchenne”), including ELEVIDYS. ELEVIDYS is a prescription gene therapy intended for a limited category of people with Duchenne.\n\nFor more information, submit a form, email attorney Aaron Dumas, Jr., or give us a call at (800) 350-6003.\n\nThe Allegations: Robbins LLP is Investigating Allegations that Sarepta Therapeutics, Inc. (SRPT) Mislead Investors Regarding the Safety its ELEVIDYS Drug\n\nAccording to the complaint, during the class period, defendants failed to disclose that: (i) ELEVIDYS posed significant safety risks to patients; (ii) ELEVIDYS trial regimes and protocols failed to detect severe side effects; and (iii) the severity of adverse events from ELEVIDYS treatment would cause the Company to halt recruitment and dosing in ELEVIDYS trials, attract regulatory scrutiny, and create greater risk around the therapy’s present and expanded approvals.\n\nPlaintiff alleges that on March 18, 2025, Sarepta issued a safety update on ELEVIDYS announcing that a patient had died following treatment with ELEVIDYS. On this news, Sarepta’s stock price fell $27.81 per share, or 27.44%, to close at $73.54 per share on March 18, 2025. Then, on June 15, 2025, Sarepta disclosed a second patient had died of acute liver failure following treatment with ELEVIDYS. The Company announced it was suspending shipments of ELEVIDYS for non-ambulatory patients while Sarepta took time to evaluate trial regimens and discussed findings with regulatory authorities. Sarepta also revealed that it was pausing dosing in one of its ELEVIDYS clinical studies. On this news, Sarepta’s stock price fell $15.24 per share, or 42.12%, to close at $20.91 per share on June 15, 2025.\n\nFinally, on June 24, 2025, the FDA announced it was investigating the risk of acute liver failure with serious outcomes following treatment with ELEVIDYS. On this news, Sarepta's stock price fell $1.52 per share, or 8.01%, to close at $17.46 per share on June 25, 2025.\n\nWhat Now: You may be eligible to participate in the class action against Sarepta Therapeutics, Inc.

            "content": "Wednesday, August 27, 2025\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team. Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK.B), Toyota Motor Corp. (TM) and McDonald's Corp. (MCD), as well as two micro-cap stocks Elite Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (ELTP) and BK Technologies Corp. (BKTI). The Zacks microcap research is unique as our research content on these small and under-the-radar companies is the only research of its type in the country.\r\n\r\nThese research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.\r\n\r\nYou can see all of today’s research reports here >>>\r\n\r\nAhead of Wall Street\r\n\r\nThe daily 'Ahead of Wall Street' article is a must-read for all investors who would like to be ready for that day's trading action. The article comes out before the market opens, attempting to make sense of that morning's economic releases and how they will affect that day's market action. You can read this article for free on our home page and can actually sign up there to get an email notification as this article comes out each morning.\r\n\r\nYou can read today's AWS here >>> Countdown to NVIDIA Earnings, PCE Report Friday\r\n\r\nToday's Featured Research Reports\r\n\r\nBerkshire Hathaway’s shares have outperformed the Zacks Insurance - Property and Casualty industry over the year-to-date period (+9% vs. +7.8%). The company is one of the largest property and casualty insurance companies, with numerous diverse business activities. A strong cash position supports earnings-accretive bolt-on buyouts and is indicative of its financial flexibility. \r\n\r\nContinued insurance business growth fuels an increase in float, drives earnings and generates maximum return on equity. The non-insurance businesses have also been doing well in the last few years. The insurer has also started increasing its investment in Japan. A sturdy capital level provides further impetus. \r\n\r\nHowever, exposure to cat(astrophic) loss induces earnings volatility and also affects underwriting results. Huge capital expenditures remain a headwind. Also, it remains to be seen how the conglomerate behemoth fares when Greg Abel succeeds Warren Buffett as CEO of Berkshire.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on Berkshire Hathaway here >>>)\r\n\r\nShares of Toyota Motor have gained +0.8% over the year-to-date period against the Zacks Automotive - Foreign industry’s gain of +5%. The company’s sales are getting a boost from the surge in hybrid adoption. The RAV4 model, with hybrid variants that make up about half of Toyota’s sales, is America's top-selling SUV. \r\n\r\nToyota Motor aims to lower hydrogen costs by promoting its use in commercial vehicles. It plans to sell its hydrogen-powered units externally, encouraging broader adoption beyond its own fleet. By increasing overall hydrogen demand, the company expects economies of scale to drive down production costs. \r\n\r\nHowever, Toyota expects its operating income for fiscal 2026 to decline year over year due to material prices, the impact of the forex rate and tariffs imposed by the U.S. government on vehicle and vehicle parts imports. Pretax profit is also expected to decline. Thus, the stock warrants a cautious stance.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on Toyota Motor here >>>)\r\n\r\nMcDonald's shares have outperformed the Zacks Retail - Restaurants industry over the year-to-date period (+10.1% vs. -2.3%). The company reported second-quarter 2025 results, wherein earnings and revenues beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Both the top and bottom lines increased year over year, driven by robust international comps, strong brand-led campaigns, loyalty expansion and solid menu innovation. \r\n\r\nThe Accelerating the Arches strategy, supported by value platforms and unit expansion, continues to drive momentum. Management remains confident in its long-term growth trajectory, underpinned by unit expansion toward 50,000 restaurants by 2027.\r\n\r\nEarnings estimates for 2025 have increased in the past 30 days, depicting analysts' optimism regarding the stock’s growth potential. However, higher beef and labor costs in Europe, and soft traffic trends in the United States, pose concerns.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on McDonald's here >>>)\r\n\r\nShares of Elite Pharmaceuticals have outperformed the Zacks Medical - Drugs industry over the past year (+98.3% vs. -0.3%). This microcap company with a market capitalization of $586.35 million is capitalizing on the $3.5 billion U.S. ADHD market with its December 2024 launch of generic Lisdexamfetamine, quickly reaching 8–10% share while generic penetration lags peers, leaving room for growth. \r\n\r\nThe first-quarter fiscal 2026 revenues surged 113.9% to $40.2 million, with gross margins expanding to 68% on the back of the shift to direct commercialization. Core Adderall IR/ER franchises provide stable cash flow as CNS and opioid analgesic launches diversify revenue. \r\n\r\nStrong liquidity ($21.7 million net cash, $67.1 million working capital) supports pipeline, M&A and global expansion. Risks include heavy reliance on Lisdexamfetamine amid pricing pressure, customer concentration, inventory build and offshore competition. The valuation reflects optimism around growth momentum, but also embeds risks tied to product concentration.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on Elite Pharmaceuticals here >>>)\r\n\r\nBK Technologies’ shares have outperformed the Zacks Wireless Equipment industry over the past year (+225.3% vs. +30.1%). This microcap company with market capitalization of $255.79 million is driving growth through its BKR Series, notably the BKR 9000, which is gaining adoption across federal, state and local agencies due to competitive pricing, full P25 compliance and interoperability. \r\n\r\nStrong orders support revenue growth, with higher ASPs boosting margins. Gross margins expanded to 47.4% in Q2 2025, aided by mix shift and outsourced manufacturing, with guidance raised above 47%. SaaS platform BK ONE introduces high-margin recurring revenue streams, expanding TAM beyond hardware. \r\n\r\nBKTI has a debt-free balance sheet, supporting R&D and market expansion. Risks include customer concentration, software execution challenges, tariff exposure and delayed BKR 9500 launch. The valuation implies a discounted entry point, offering investors upside as BKTI scales high-margin products and SaaS, while managing execution risks.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on BK Technologies here >>>)\r\n\r\nOther noteworthy reports we are featuring today include Eaton Corp. plc (ETN), American International Group, Inc. (AIG) and Ryanair Holdings plc (RYAAY).\r\n\r\nMark Vickery\r\nSenior Editor\r\n\r\nNote: Sheraz Mian heads the Zacks Equity Research department and is a well-regarded expert of aggregate earnings.

            "title": "Why Elanco (ELAN) Stock Is Trading Up Today",
            "content": "What Happened?\n\nShares of animal health company Elanco (NYSE:ELAN) jumped 4.4% in the morning session after the company announced it will be joining the S&P MidCap 400 index.\n\nThe animal health company is set to replace Sarepta Therapeutics in the index, with the change becoming effective before the market opens on Tuesday, September 2. This inclusion is a significant positive catalyst because it typically forces index funds and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that track the S&P MidCap 400 to purchase shares of Elanco to align their portfolios. The anticipated increase in demand from these institutional investors is expected to boost the stock's liquidity and valuation. Reflecting the positive sentiment, the company's shares also touched a new 52-week high.\n\nAfter the initial pop the shares cooled down to $18.60, up 3.9% from previous close.\n\nIs now the time to buy Elanco? Access our full analysis report here, it’s free.\n\nWhat Is The Market Telling Us\n\nElanco’s shares are somewhat volatile and have had 13 moves greater than 5% over the last year. In that context, today’s move indicates the market considers this news meaningful but not something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business.\n\nThe biggest move we wrote about over the last year was 4 months ago when the stock gained 21.2% on the news that the company reported decent first quarter 2025 results which beat analysts' EPS expectations and included constant currency revenue outperformance. Organic sales were up 4%, thanks to strong demand in cattle health and good traction from new pet meds like Credelio Quattro. Even though sales were flat, operating margins improved, a sign they're managing prices and costs pretty well. On the other hand, its full-year EBITDA guidance missed. Overall, we think this was a decent quarter with some key metrics above expectations.\n\nElanco is up 54.3% since the beginning of the year, and at $18.60 per share, has set a new 52-week high. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of Elanco’s shares 5 years ago would now be looking at an investment worth $661.12.\n\nToday’s young investors likely haven’t read the timeless lessons in Gorilla Game: Picking Winners In High Technology because it was written more than 20 years ago when Microsoft and Apple were first establishing their supremacy. But if we apply the same principles, then enterprise software stocks leveraging their own generative AI capabilities may well be the Gorillas of the future. So, in that spirit, we are excited to present our Special Free Report on a profitable, fast-growing enterprise software stock that is already riding the automation wave and looking to catch the generative AI next.\n\nView Comments",

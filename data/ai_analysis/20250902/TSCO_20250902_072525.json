            "title": "This week in Trumponomics: The Cracker Barrel follies",
            "content": "It’s a safe bet President Trump has never dined at a Cracker Barrel (CBRL). But like millions of Americans, he has strong opinions about the kitschy roadside chain.\n\nDuring a week in which he made a power grab at the Federal Reserve and defenestrated the nation’s top public health official, Trump somehow found time to weigh in on a rebranding effort at America’s 31st largest restaurant company.\n\nAs part of a turnaround plan, Tennessee-based Cracker Barrel unveiled a new logo on Aug. 19 that airbrushed out an old dude in overalls leaning against a barrel. The new logo had no image, just the company name against an orange backdrop vaguely familiar to any motorist who has ever perused the skyline near an interstate exit.\n\nSomething nefarious was obviously afoot. Anti-woke vigilantes attacked the company on social media, with Donald Trump Jr. posting, “WTF is wrong with Cracker Barrel?!” Trump Sr. finally weighed in, with a post saying, “Cracker Barrel should go back to the old logo [and] admit a mistake.”\n\nThat presidential suggestion sent the stock down 8%, and the company must have known its barrel was about to become the next bit of fuel tossed on the culture war bonfire. So it backed down. “We thank our guests for sharing their voices,” the company squished in an Aug. 26 statement that got 254,000 likes on X. \"Our new logo is going away and our 'Old Timer' will remain.\"\n\nIs this about anything? Why does anybody care about the hokey logo of a mediocre food chain? Are Americans really this bored?\n\nThe White House took credit for the restoration of the original logo, as if it had salvaged a national treasure. In Trump’s view, maybe it is. The company got its start in the South in 1969 as a gimmicky way to sell gasoline. The front porches and cluttered gift shops are meant to evoke a country homestead. The company went public in 1981 and has been a corporate operation ever since. Monetizing kitsch seems like something Trump can relate to.Grandpa's gone. The old guy in the overalls disappeared from Cracker Barrel's experimental logo.

Cracker Barrel has been losing business for years, with diners questioning the chain’s “relevance,” according to 2024 remarks by the CEO. The same sense of nostalgia some patrons are now praising seems like musty, outdated shtick to others. Cracker Barrel’s profit margin dropped from 7.3% in 2019 to 1.2% in 2024, according to Capital IQ. The stock recovered from the logo slip this week, but it’s down a ghastly 67% from its peak in 2018.\n\nStory Continues\n\nNasdaqGS - Delayed Quote•USD\n\n(CBRL)\n\nFollow  View Quote Details\n\n59.82\n\n-0.24\n\n(-0.40%)\n\nAt close: August 29 at 4:00:01 PM EDT  Advanced Chart\n\nTrump has no concern about the profitability of any business that isn’t his own. But he does have a predator’s sense of how to exploit somebody else’s misfortune for his own benefit. Cracker Barrel unwittingly made itself an opportunity for Trump to hone his own brand.\n\nCracker Barrel is a “Republican brand” that's overrepresented in rural areas and other places Trump voters happen to live. (Other Republican brands include Tractor Supply, Hobby Lobby, and Bass Pro Shops.) That makes it susceptible to anything that feels like \"wokeness,\" urbanity, or even modernity. This aligns with Trump’s own “Make America Great Again” slogan, which is based on the premise that the nation’s best days were at some point in the past, when multiculturalism was in the closet and traditional values ruled.Grandpa's back. The old logo is staying. (Photo by Gregory WALTON / AFP) (Photo by GREGORY WALTON/AFP via Getty Images)·GREGORY WALTON via Getty Images\n\nTaking Mr. Overalls out of the Cracker Barrel logo wasn’t wokeism. It was probably an effort to make a stodgy brand that could use some pep more youthful. But it was a change. And when you change in Trump Country, you’re vulnerable, because the whole movement is about undoing change. \"Making America Great Again\" means prioritizing the past over the present: fossil fuels over renewables, blue-collar toilers over knowledge workers, beliefs over facts, the old ways over the new.\n\n,CEOs have learned to sidestep politics and leave the culture wars to others, lest they face the wrath of the Trumpy right, as Bud Light, Target, Disney and others have had to do. Cracker Barrel got off easier, but it still added a couple of new lessons to the anti-woke curriculum.\n\nOne is to change stealthily. Businesses need to modernize all the time, to stay relevant with customers, employees, and shareholders. But they don’t need to announce every change or upheave the most visible parts of the business. Constant microevolution now looks like a better bet than the big rebranding efforts that have been a staple of the corporate playbook for decades.\n\nIt also can’t hurt to have an in-house anti-woke red team that probes every corporate move for cultural vulnerability. The US military constantly wargames its own plans to detect vulnerabilities, setting up skilled “red teams” as the enemy and encouraging them to tear the US battle plan to shreds. Maybe every consumer brand needs its own Don Jr. to detect policies or strategies that might stoke outrage in Trumpworld. Those, you avoid. At least until Americans find better things to worry about.\n\nRick Newman is a senior columnist for Yahoo Finance.

            "title": "Does Tractor Supply (NASDAQ:TSCO) Have A Healthy Balance Sheet?",
            "content": "Some say volatility, rather than debt, is the best way to think about risk as an investor, but Warren Buffett famously said that 'Volatility is far from synonymous with risk.' So it might be obvious that you need to consider debt, when you think about how risky any given stock is, because too much debt can sink a company. Importantly, Tractor Supply Company (NASDAQ:TSCO) does carry debt. But the real question is whether this debt is making the company risky.\n\nAI is about to change healthcare. These 20 stocks are working on everything from early diagnostics to drug discovery. The best part - they are all under $10bn in marketcap - there is still time to get in early.\n\nWhen Is Debt Dangerous?\n\nDebt and other liabilities become risky for a business when it cannot easily fulfill those obligations, either with free cash flow or by raising capital at an attractive price. If things get really bad, the lenders can take control of the business. However, a more usual (but still expensive) situation is where a company must dilute shareholders at a cheap share price simply to get debt under control. Of course, plenty of companies use debt to fund growth, without any negative consequences. The first thing to do when considering how much debt a business uses is to look at its cash and debt together.\n\nWhat Is Tractor Supply's Debt?\n\nAs you can see below, Tractor Supply had US$1.67b of debt, at June 2025, which is about the same as the year before. You can click the chart for greater detail. On the flip side, it has US$225.8m in cash leading to net debt of about US$1.45b.NasdaqGS:TSCO Debt to Equity History August 30th 2025\n\nA Look At Tractor Supply's Liabilities\n\nWe can see from the most recent balance sheet that Tractor Supply had liabilities of US$2.76b falling due within a year, and liabilities of US$5.31b due beyond that. Offsetting these obligations, it had cash of US$225.8m as well as receivables valued at US$21.6m due within 12 months. So it has liabilities totalling US$7.82b more than its cash and near-term receivables, combined.\n\nShop Top Mortgage Rates\n\nYour Path to Homeownership  Learn More\n\nA quicker path to financial freedom  Learn More\n\nPersonalized rates in minutes  Learn More\n\nPowered by Money.com - Yahoo may earn commission from the links above.\n\nThis deficit isn't so bad because Tractor Supply is worth a massive US$33.2b, and thus could probably raise enough capital to shore up its balance sheet, if the need arose. However, it is still worthwhile taking a close look at its ability to pay off debt.\n\nView our latest analysis for Tractor Supply\n\nIn order to size up a company's debt relative to its earnings, we calculate its net debt divided by its earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) and its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) divided by its interest expense (its interest cover). This way, we consider both the absolute quantum of the debt, as well as the interest rates paid on it.\n\nStory Continues\n\nTractor Supply has a low net debt to EBITDA ratio of only 0.74. And its EBIT easily covers its interest expense, being 21.4 times the size. So you could argue it is no more threatened by its debt than an elephant is by a mouse. While Tractor Supply doesn't seem to have gained much on the EBIT line, at least earnings remain stable for now. When analysing debt levels, the balance sheet is the obvious place to start. But it is future earnings, more than anything, that will determine Tractor Supply's ability to maintain a healthy balance sheet going forward. So if you're focused on the future you can check out this freereport showing analyst profit forecasts.\n\nFinally, a company can only pay off debt with cold hard cash, not accounting profits. So we always check how much of that EBIT is translated into free cash flow. Looking at the most recent three years, Tractor Supply recorded free cash flow of 47% of its EBIT, which is weaker than we'd expect. That's not great, when it comes to paying down debt.\n\nOur View\n\nOn our analysis Tractor Supply's interest cover should signal that it won't have too much trouble with its debt. But the other factors we noted above weren't so encouraging. For instance it seems like it has to struggle a bit to grow its EBIT. Considering this range of data points, we think Tractor Supply is in a good position to manage its debt levels. Having said that, the load is sufficiently heavy that we would recommend any shareholders keep a close eye on it. There's no doubt that we learn most about debt from the balance sheet. But ultimately, every company can contain risks that exist outside of the balance sheet. For example, we've discovered 1 warning sign for Tractor Supply that you should be aware of before investing here.\n\nOf course, if you're the type of investor who prefers buying stocks without the burden of debt, then don't hesitate to discover our exclusive list of net cash growth stocks, today.\n\nHave feedback on this article?

            "content": "For most investors, how much a stock's price changes over time is important. Not only can it impact your investment portfolio, but it can also help you compare investment results across sectors and industries.\n\nAnother thing that can drive investing is the fear of missing out, or FOMO. This particularly applies to tech giants and popular consumer-facing stocks.\n\nWhat if you'd invested in Tractor Supply (TSCO) ten years ago? It may not have been easy to hold on to TSCO for all that time, but if you did, how much would your investment be worth today?\n\nTractor Supply's Business In-Depth\n\nWith that in mind, let's take a look at Tractor Supply's main business drivers.\n\nHeadquartered in Brentwood, TN, Tractor Supply Company is the largest retail farm and ranch store chain in the United States. The company focuses on recreational farmers and ranchers as well as tradesmen and small businesses. It offers a wide array of merchandise such as livestock, pet and animal products, maintenance products for agricultural and rural use, hardware and tools, lawn and garden power equipment, truck and towing products, and work apparel.\n\nStores of Tractor Supply are primarily located in rural areas and the suburbs of major cities, which have inside selling space of 15,000–20,000 square feet with a similar area of outside space, used to demonstrate agricultural fencing, livestock equipment and horse stalls. Petsense stores have roughly 5,500 square feet of inside selling space. For Tractor Supply retail locations, the company has a standard design for the new built-to-suit locations, including nearly 15,500 square  feet  of  inside  selling  space.\r\n\r\nTractor Supply’s broad assortment of products is tailored to meet the regional and geographic needs of its markets. Moreover, the retailer’s full line of product offerings is supported by a strong in-stock inventory position with an average of 16,000–19,500 unique products per store.\r\n \r\nApart from selling nationally recognized branded merchandise, the company also markets an increasing list of products under its “private-label programs.” The latter include Masterhand and Job Smart (tools and tool chests), Dumor and Producers Pride (livestock feed) and Retriever and Paws ‘n Claws (pet foods). Further, the company recently acquired 100% stake in Petsense, to fortify its presence in the pet specialty space.\r\n\r\nTractor Supply operates retail stores  under  the  names  Tractor Supply Company, Del’s Feed & Farm Supply, and Petsense as well as operate websites under the names TractorSupply.com and Petsense.com.  Its online selling websites are  expected  to  offer  expanded  assortment of products beyond in-store as well as boost store traffic through buy online, pickup in-store and ship to store programs.\r\n\r\nAs of June 28, 2025, the company operated 2,542 stores, including 2,335 Tractor Supply stores in 49 states and 207 Petsense by Tractor Supply stores across 23 states.\n\nStory Continues\n\nBottom Line\n\nAnyone can invest, but building a successful investment portfolio takes a combination of a few things: research, patience, and a little bit of risk. So, if you had invested in Tractor Supply a decade ago, you're probably feeling pretty good about your investment today.\n\nAccording to our calculations, a $1000 investment made in August 2015 would be worth $3,668.46, or a gain of 266.85%, as of August 29, 2025, and this return excludes dividends but includes price increases.\n\nThe S&P 500 rose 226.91% and the price of gold increased 189.82% over the same time frame in comparison.\n\nLooking ahead, analysts are expecting more upside for TSCO.\n\nShares of Tractor Supply have outpaced the industry in the past three months, courtesy of its sturdy demand and market share gains. The company benefits from the execution of the everyday low-price strategy and reduced transportation. Its growth initiatives and store openings bode well. TSCO is gaining from its Life Out Here Strategy, the ‘ONETractor' plan and the Neighbor's Club program. These strengths aided TSCO's sales in second-quarter 2025, with comparable store sales up 1.5%. However, Tractor Supply has been grappling with higher SG&A expenses for a while now. The company faced pressure from an unusually late spring season in the second quarter, which disrupted sales in certain discretionary and seasonal categories. It expects the tariff-related cost increases to create gross margin headwinds in the second half.\n\nOver the past four weeks, shares have rallied 10.01%, and there have been 9 higher earnings estimate revisions in the past two months for fiscal 2025 compared to none lower. The consensus estimate has moved up as well.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.

            "title": "Viasat Options Activity Surged Wednesday, but These 2 Trades With 143-Day DTEs Look More Attractive",
            "content": "Viasat (VSAT) [https://www.barchart.com/quotes/VSAT] had a busy day in the options market on Wednesday. Its options volume on the day was 109,914, 11 times its 30-day average. At the same time, its Jan. 16/2026 $35 call had the highest Vol/OI (volume-to-open-interest) ratio at 343.19, more than double that of the second-highest.\n\nI don’t know the last time the provider of global communications solutions had a Vol/OI ratio over 100,000. I went back 24 months, and the second-highest daily volume was 39,655, on Aug. 6. Eight of Viasat’s 10 highest daily volumes for options have come in 2025. \n\nNot surprisingly, Viasat’s shares are up 281% in 2025. Options volumes perk up when stocks make big moves in either direction. Unfortunately, for shareholders holding VSAT since August 2023, they’re back to breakeven despite this year’s big move. \n\nIn fiscal 2022 (March year-end), Viasat had retained earnings of $233.5 million on its balance sheet. By fiscal 2025, the surplus had turned to a deficit of $325.5 million. If not for the sale of assets from its Link-16 Tactical Data Links business (the Link-16 TDL Business) for nearly $2 billion in cash, its deficit would be considerably higher. \n\nThe lack of profitability explains the poor performance of its stock before 2025. While it’s tempting to bet on Viasat options, I’ve identified three alternatives that expire in 143 days that make better long-term investments. \n\nDUOLINGO (DUOL)\n\nDuolingo (DUOL) [https://www.barchart.com/quotes/DUOL] had two unusually active options yesterday, expiring on Jan. 16/2026. \n\nThe $450 call has a profit probability of 15.99% and the $500 call’s profit probability is 11.27%. Both have a low probability of trading at or above breakeven. To do so would require gains of 46.6% and 60.2%, respectively, over the next 143 days. That isn’t happening. \n\nHowever, consider two things before discarding my suggestion. \n\nFirst, Duolingo is operating at a highly efficient level. Despite losing 42% since hitting a 52-week high of $544.93 on May 14, the company continues to grow its top and bottom lines. \n\nOn Aug. 6, it reported second-quarter revenues of $252.3 million, nearly 5% higher than Wall Street expectations, with $0.91, 33 cents higher than the consensus. More importantly, it raised its guidance for 2025. On the top line, it now expects annual revenue of $1.015 billion, up from $991.5 million previously. \n\nOn the bottom line, it expects adjusted EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) of $291.8 million at the midpoint of its guidance, representing a 52% increase from $191.9 million a year earlier. \n\nIt continues to grow both its monthly active users and paid subscribers. As long as it continues to do that, it will be fine. \n\nSecondly, the share price only has to appreciate by $65.35 (20.2%) to double your money for the $450 call and $59.29 (18.6%) for the $500 call. The expected move, up or down, between now and Jan. 16 is 26.34%. It’s more than doable. \n\nWith a leverage ratio of between 95% and 97%, it presents a reasonable risk-reward proposition.   \n\nTRACTOR SUPPLY (TSCO)\n\nThe rural lifestyle specialty retailer had one unusually active option yesterday. Although its Vol/OI ratio was nothing to write home about at 2.47, it’s a business I continue to like in the retail space.  \n\nI can’t remember the first time I wrote about the Tennessee-based business. It’s probably more than a decade ago. \n\nI first noticed Tractor Supply (TSCO) [https://www.barchart.com/quotes/TSCO] because there was a retailer in Ontario where I used to live called TSC Stores. It had an identical logo, but only operated in Canada. TSC Stores was the Canadian operations of Tractor Supply until 1979, when its U.S. parent spun it off. TSC stores were acquired by Peavey Industries in 2017 and fully rebranded to Peavey Mart in 2021. Peavey Industries filed for CREDITOR PROTECTION [https://lfpress.com/news/local-news/peavey-mart-why-a-90-store-farm-retail-chain-is-disappearing] in January. But I digress.  \n\nWhat attracted me to Tractor Supply was its niche focus on customers who were neither full-time, large-scale farmers nor city slickers, but rather those individuals who like to spend their weekends and after-work hours tending to their acreage. \n\nIt delivered a breadth of products that you couldn’t get all in one place, providing convenience at reasonable prices. From what I can see on Reddit, some of that has disappeared. Living in Canada, I can’t physically confirm this, but it’s interesting to note. \n\nDespite the headwinds facing Tractor Supply, its stock hit an all-time high of $63.99 on July 1. Its shares are up 16.4% year-to-date and 110.5% over the past five years, 30% higher than the S&P 500. \n\nAnalysts are mixed about its stock. There are 31 covering TSCO. Of those, 16 rate it a Buy [https://www.barchart.com/stocks/quotes/TSCO/analyst-ratings] (3.94 out of 5), with a target price of $63.28, which is slightly higher than its current share price. According to S&P Global Market Intelligence, Tractor Supply is expected to earn $2.10 a share in 2025 and $2.24 in 2026. It trades at x times the 2026 estimate. It trades at 27.6 times the 2026 estimate. That’s at the high end over the past decade.  \n\nWhile I definitely see some valuation concerns, Tractor Supply continues to dominate in this niche category. It will continue to do so until Walmart (WMT) [https://www.barchart.com/quotes/WMT] or Home Depot (HD) [https://www.barchart.com/quotes/HD] decides that they want it instead. \n\nMeanwhile, the Jan. 16/2026 $56 put from yesterday is a good way for options investors who like the stock to generate income while waiting for a better entry point.\n\nThe bid price of $1.45 is an annualized return of 6.9% [($1.45 bid price / $56 strike price - $1.45) * 365 / 143]. It’s not a huge income given the 143-day DTE, but the share price has to fall to $54.55 before you’re out of pocket.  The odds of its share price trading above $54.55 by expiration are about 76%. That’s relatively high. \n\nAt worst, you buy $100 worth of TSCO stock at $54.55. The expected move between now and January, up or down, is 11.06%, indicating that the share price will still be higher than the breakeven point.  \n\n_ On the date of publication, Will Ashworth [https://www.barchart.com/news/authors/120/will-ashworth] did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

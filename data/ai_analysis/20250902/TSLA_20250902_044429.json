            "content": "Tesla’s European slump deepened in August as tougher competition and brand headwinds weighed on sales, with a few notable exceptions.\n\nRegistrations fell sharply across several key markets: France (-47.3% year over year while the overall market rose 2.2%), Sweden (-84% with EV sales flat and the market up 6%), Denmark (-42%), the Netherlands (-50%), and Italy (-4.4%). Norway bucked the trend—Tesla registrations rose 21.3%—but BYD surged 218% there. After seven consecutive monthly declines, Portugal saw a 28.7% Tesla uptick. In Spain, where EV subsidies can reach €7,000, Tesla deliveries jumped 161% to 1,435, yet BYD outpaced it with more than 400% growth to 1,827. Year to date in Spain, BYD sales are up 675% (14,181 units) versus Tesla’s 11.6% (9,303).\n\nSwitch Auto Insurance and Save Today!\n\nThe Insurance Savings You Expect  Learn More\n\nAffordable Auto Insurance, Customized for You  Learn More\n\nGreat Rates and Award-Winning Service  Learn More\n\nPowered by Money.com - Yahoo may earn commission from the links above.\n\nAnalysts point to a tougher landscape and an aging lineup. Tesla hasn’t launched a new mass-market model since the Model Y in 2020, while Chinese entrants and legacy automakers flood showrooms with fresh EVs. Schmidt Automotive notes Europe-wide market share for Tesla in Western Europe slid to 1.7% in H1 2025 from 2.5% in 2024, calling Elon Musk’s July claim of “no issues” on volumes out of step with reality. Tesla previously blamed a production shift to a refreshed Model Y, but August data still showed steep Model Y declines in Denmark (-46.5%) and Sweden (-87%).\n\nBrand perception is an added drag. Elon Musk’s polarizing politics—support for Donald Trump and European far-right parties—have sparked a consumer backlash. EV site Electrifying.com says over half of surveyed buyers are put off purchasing a Tesla because of Musk.\n\nAggressive 2023 price cuts have also depressed residual values, swelling the used market and undercutting new-car pricing power. U.K. tracker Marketcheck reported record used-Tesla sales in July (+270%) and a new low for average used Model Y prices.\n\nMeanwhile, supply dynamics favor rivals. BYD continues to scale rapidly across Europe, capitalizing on the breadth of its lineup and sharp pricing. With competition intensifying and secondhand values under pressure, Tesla’s path back to growth in Europe likely hinges on new product, steadier pricing, and rebuilding brand appeal.\n\nRead this article on OilPrice.com\n\nView Comments",

            "content": "This article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nSouth Korea's retail crowdthe same cohort that once turbocharged Tesla's (NASDAQ:TSLA) meteoric risehas started bailing. In August alone, Korean individuals sold a net $657 million worth of Tesla shares, marking the biggest monthly exit since at least early 2019, based on Bloomberg's calculation of Korea Securities Depository data. Over the past four months, the total pullback has hit $1.8 billion. The message? Momentum is shifting. Traders who once clung to Tesla's EV and AI promises are chasing something spicier.\n\nIs TSLA fairly valued? Test your thesis with our free DCF calculator.\n\nThat something is crypto proxies. Bitmine Immersion Technologies, seen by some as a side-door play on Ether, pulled in $253 million in net inflows. Even the double-leveraged TSLL ETF (NASDAQ:TSLL), which gives twice the exposure to Tesla stock, suffered its worst month since early 2024, hemorrhaging $554 million. The shift isn't just about performanceit's about narrative. As one former Tesla bull who first bought in 2019 put it: Tesla used to inspire. Now it's failing to lead with its own AI story. He's rotated out entirely.\n\nYet even with the cooling interest, Tesla still holds the No. 1 spot among foreign stocks held by Korean retail investors, with $21.9 billion in exposure. Nvidia and Palantir trail far behind. But popularity isn't immunity. Retail appetite is fickle, and narratives matter. Right now, crypto is stealing Tesla's thunderand for a trader base hungry for adrenaline, that may be all it takes.\n\nView Comments",

            "title": "BLBD or TSLA: Which Is the Better Value Stock Right Now?",
            "content": "Investors with an interest in Automotive - Domestic stocks have likely encountered both Blue Bird (BLBD) and Tesla (TSLA). But which of these two stocks presents investors with the better value opportunity right now? Let's take a closer look.\n\nEveryone has their own methods for finding great value opportunities, but our model includes pairing an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system with a strong Zacks Rank. The Zacks Rank is a proven strategy that targets companies with positive earnings estimate revision trends, while our Style Scores work to grade companies based on specific traits.\n\nRight now, Blue Bird is sporting a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy), while Tesla has a Zacks Rank of #4 (Sell). This system places an emphasis on companies that have seen positive earnings estimate revisions, so investors should feel comfortable knowing that BLBD is likely seeing its earnings outlook improve to a greater extent. But this is just one factor that value investors are interested in.\n\nValue investors also try to analyze a wide range of traditional figures and metrics to help determine whether a company is undervalued at its current share price levels.\n\nThe Style Score Value grade factors in a variety of key fundamental metrics, including the popular P/E ratio, P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a number of other key stats that are commonly used by value investors.\n\nBLBD currently has a forward P/E ratio of 14.47, while TSLA has a forward P/E of 201.41. We also note that BLBD has a PEG ratio of 1.58. This metric is used similarly to the famous P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock's expected earnings growth rate. TSLA currently has a PEG ratio of 8.41.\n\nAnother notable valuation metric for BLBD is its P/B ratio of 8.31. Investors use the P/B ratio to look at a stock's market value versus its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. By comparison, TSLA has a P/B of 13.8.\n\nThese metrics, and several others, help BLBD earn a Value grade of B, while TSLA has been given a Value grade of D.\n\nBLBD sticks out from TSLA in both our Zacks Rank and Style Scores models, so value investors will likely feel that BLBD is the better option right now.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

            "content": "This article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nTesla (TSLA, Financials) is moving forward with its plans for robotaxis at a far different pace than Alphabet's (GOOGL, Financials) Waymo. business experts think that the autonomous ride-hailing business might be worth trillions of dollars over the next ten years. These two techniques could help determine the early winners in this market.Tesla started a test program in Austin in June, and CEO Elon Musk has said that \"half the U.S. population\" would be able to use it by the end of the year. The business is putting its money on cameras and AI instead of comprehensive maps and more sensors. Musk has said that if the system works in a few places, it can easily spread throughout the country.Waymo has gone a different way. The Alphabet business has been experimenting since 2017 and currently offers paid trips with no drivers in certain regions, including Phoenix and San Francisco. It uses high-definition maps, a lot of sensor data, and years of slow rollouts to improve safety and responsiveness in the area.Analysts say the distinction is clear: Tesla's way is cheaper and quicker to scale, but it has more hazards. Waymo's way is slower but thought to be safer in the near term. According to Bank of America analysts, Waymo lost as much as $1.5 billion last year. Morningstar, on the other hand, says that Tesla won't have completely self-driving robotaxis until 2028.Both companies face regulatory hurdles and community pushback. Waymo's cars have had problems in Austin with interpreting traffic police and even drove into floods. Tesla has also come under fire when one of its cars rushed past a school zone near a college for the deaf.For investors, the race shows that Tesla is betting on self-driving cars to make up for falling EV sales, while Alphabet is supporting Waymo's slow growth even if the company is losing money.\n\nView Comments",

            "content": "Investors looking for hidden gems should keep an eye on small-cap stocks because they’re frequently overlooked by Wall Street. Many opportunities exist in this part of the market, but it is also a high-risk, high-reward environment due to the lack of reliable analyst price targets.\n\nThe downside that can come from buying these securities is precisely why we started StockStory - to isolate the long-term winners from the losers so you can invest with confidence. That said, here is one small-cap stock that could be the next 100 bagger and two that could be down big.\n\nTwo Small-Cap Stocks to Sell:\n\nAstec (ASTE)\n\nMarket Cap: $1.05 billion\n\nInventing the first ever double-barrel hot-mix asphalt plant, Astec (NASDAQ:ASTE) provides machines and equipment for building roads, processing raw materials, and producing concrete.\n\nWhy Do We Think Twice About ASTE?\n\nSales pipeline suggests its future revenue growth won’t meet our standards as its backlog averaged 28.2% declines over the past two years Gross margin of 23.8% is below its competitors, leaving less money to invest in areas like marketing and R&D Lacking free cash flow generation means it has few chances to reinvest for growth, repurchase shares, or distribute capital\n\nAstec’s stock price of $46.03 implies a valuation ratio of 17.8x forward P/E. Read our free research report to see why you should think twice about including ASTE in your portfolio, it’s free.\n\n10x Genomics (TXG)\n\nMarket Cap: $1.75 billion\n\nFounded in 2012 by scientists seeking to overcome limitations in traditional biological research methods, 10x Genomics (NASDAQ:TXG) develops instruments, consumables, and software that enable researchers to analyze biological systems at single-cell resolution and spatial context.\n\nWhy Is TXG Not Exciting?\n\n6.5% annual revenue growth over the last two years was slower than its healthcare peers Negative free cash flow raises questions about the return timeline for its investments Negative returns on capital show management lost money while trying to expand the business\n\nAt $14.03 per share, 10x Genomics trades at 3x forward price-to-sales. Check out our free in-depth research report to learn more about why TXG doesn’t pass our bar.\n\nOne Small-Cap Stock to Buy:\n\nVital Farms (VITL)\n\nMarket Cap: $2.31 billion\n\nWith an emphasis on ethically produced products, Vital Farms (NASDAQ:VITL) specializes in pasture-raised eggs and butter.\n\nWhy Do We Love VITL?\n\nProducts are flying off the shelves as its unit sales averaged 20.1% growth over the past two years Exciting sales outlook for the upcoming 12 months calls for 31.3% growth, an acceleration from its three-year trend Earnings per share have massively outperformed its peers over the last three years, increasing by 109% annually\n\nStory Continues\n\nVital Farms is trading at $51.05 per share, or 36.6x forward P/E. Is now a good time to buy? See for yourself in our comprehensive research report, it’s free.\n\nHigh-Quality Stocks for All Market Conditions\n\nTrump’s April 2025 tariff bombshell triggered a massive market selloff, but stocks have since staged an impressive recovery, leaving those who panic sold on the sidelines.\n\nTake advantage of the rebound by checking out our Top 6 Stocks for this week. This is a curated list of our High Quality stocks that have generated a market-beating return of 183% over the last five years (as of March 31st 2025).\n\nStocks that made our list in 2020 include now familiar names such as Nvidia (+1,545% between March 2020 and March 2025) as well as under-the-radar businesses like the once-micro-cap company Kadant (+351% five-year return).

            "content": "What Happened?\n\nA number of stocks jumped in the afternoon session after the major indices rebounded, as Fed Chair Jerome Powell delivered dovish remarks at the much-awaited Jackson Hole symposium. Powell suggested that with inflation risks moderating and unemployment remaining low, the Federal Reserve might consider a shift in its monetary policy stance, including potential interest rate cuts. This outlook eased market concerns about prolonged high interest rates and their impact on economic growth. The prospect of lower borrowing costs bolstered investor confidence, particularly in sectors that have lagged, leading to a broad rally across the market.\n\nThe stock market overreacts to news, and big price drops can present good opportunities to buy high-quality stocks.\n\nAmong others, the following stocks were impacted:\n\nResearch Tools & Consumables company Bio-Techne (NASDAQ:TECH) jumped 5.8%.

Access our full analysis report here, it’s free.\n\nZooming In On 10x Genomics (TXG)\n\n10x Genomics’s shares are extremely volatile and have had 47 moves greater than 5% over the last year. In that context, today’s move indicates the market considers this news meaningful but not something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business.\n\nThe previous big move we wrote about was 1 day ago when the stock dropped 3.1% on the news that markets continued to decline, as investors grew cautious ahead of a key speech by Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. The move came as U.S. equity markets recorded a fifth consecutive day of losses for major indexes like the S&P 500, with technology stocks experiencing the largest declines. Investors have grown wary that the sharp rally in the tech sector since April may have advanced too far. The market-wide caution is largely driven by the upcoming Jackson Hole symposium, a meeting of central bankers, where traders are anxiously awaiting Fed Chair Powell's speech on Friday for guidance on the future path of interest rates.\n\nStory Continues\n\n10x Genomics is down 0.2% since the beginning of the year, and at $14.16 per share, it is trading 39.7% below its 52-week high of $23.49 from August 2024. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of 10x Genomics’s shares 5 years ago would now be looking at an investment worth $133.75.\n\nToday’s young investors likely haven’t read the timeless lessons in Gorilla Game: Picking Winners In High Technology because it was written more than 20 years ago when Microsoft and Apple were first establishing their supremacy. But if we apply the same principles, then enterprise software stocks leveraging their own generative AI capabilities may well be the Gorillas of the future. So, in that spirit, we are excited to present our Special Free Report on a profitable, fast-growing enterprise software stock that is already riding the automation wave and looking to catch the generative AI next.\n\nView Comments",

            "content": "Cathie Wood’s ARK ETF published their daily trades for Monday, August 18th, 2025, showcasing a continued focus on the biotech sector while reducing exposure in defense. The largest trade of the day was the purchase of 170,471 shares of GeneDx Holdings Corp (NASDAQ:WGS), with a total dollar value of $21,540,715, emphasizing ARK’s bullish stance on genomic research and personalized medicine.\n\nFollowing the trend, ARK’s ARKK ETF bought 123,336 shares of  Robinhood Markets  Inc (NASDAQ:HOOD), investing another $14,081,271 in the fintech company. The move suggests a growing confidence in Robinhood’s business model and future prospects.\n\nARK also increased its position in CRISPR Therapeutics AG (NASDAQ:CRSP), acquiring 176,811 shares worth $10,560,921. This trade aligns with ARK’s high conviction in gene-editing technologies, which have been a recurring theme in their investment strategy.\n\nAnother significant trade was the purchase of 395,097 shares of  Beam Therapeutics Inc  (NASDAQ:BEAM) valued at $7,040,628. Beam Therapeutics has been a consistent addition to ARK’s portfolio, indicating a strong belief in the company’s precision medicine approach.\n\nIn the field of agriculture and construction machinery, ARK diversified its holdings by buying 10,273 shares of  Deere & Co  (NYSE:DE), spreading the purchase across its ARKK and ARKQ ETFs for a total of $5,021,442.

            "content": "As you might know, Victoria's Secret & Co. (NYSE:VSCO) just kicked off its latest second-quarter results with some very strong numbers. The company beat forecasts, with revenue of US$1.5b, some 3.8% above estimates, and statutory earnings per share (EPS) coming in at US$0.20, 83% ahead of expectations. This is an important time for investors, as they can track a company's performance in its report, look at what experts are forecasting for next year, and see if there has been any change to expectations for the business. So we gathered the latest post-earnings forecasts to see what estimates suggest is in store for next year.\n\nWe've found 21 US stocks that are forecast to pay a dividend yield of over 6% next year. See the full list for free.NYSE:VSCO Earnings and Revenue Growth August 31st 2025\n\nFollowing last week's earnings report, Victoria's Secret's nine analysts are forecasting 2026 revenues to be US$6.34b, approximately in line with the last 12 months. Statutory per share are forecast to be US$1.88, approximately in line with the last 12 months. Yet prior to the latest earnings, the analysts had been anticipated revenues of US$6.24b and earnings per share (EPS) of US$1.82 in 2026. So the consensus seems to have become somewhat more optimistic on Victoria's Secret's earnings potential following these results.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for Victoria's Secret\n\nThe consensus price target rose 6.6% to US$22.70, suggesting that higher earnings estimates flow through to the stock's valuation as well. That's not the only conclusion we can draw from this data however, as some investors also like to consider the spread in estimates when evaluating analyst price targets. There are some variant perceptions on Victoria's Secret, with the most bullish analyst valuing it at US$27.00 and the most bearish at US$17.00 per share. As you can see, analysts are not all in agreement on the stock's future, but the range of estimates is still reasonably narrow, which could suggest that the outcome is not totally unpredictable.\n\nOf course, another way to look at these forecasts is to place them into context against the industry itself. One thing stands out from these estimates, which is that Victoria's Secret is forecast to grow faster in the future than it has in the past, with revenues expected to display 2.4% annualised growth until the end of 2026. If achieved, this would be a much better result than the 0.5% annual decline over the past five years. Compare this against analyst estimates for the broader industry, which suggest that (in aggregate) industry revenues are expected to grow 5.8% annually for the foreseeable future. Although Victoria's Secret's revenues are expected to improve, it seems that the analysts are still bearish on the business, forecasting it to grow slower than the broader industry.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nThe most important thing here is that the analysts upgraded their earnings per share estimates, suggesting that there has been a clear increase in optimism towards Victoria's Secret following these results. Fortunately, the analysts also reconfirmed their revenue estimates, suggesting that it's tracking in line with expectations. Although our data does suggest that Victoria's Secret's revenue is expected to perform worse than the wider industry. There was also a nice increase in the price target, with the analysts clearly feeling that the intrinsic value of the business is improving.\n\nKeeping that in mind, we still think that the longer term trajectory of the business is much more important for investors to consider.

Net sales grew by 3% year-over-year, with comp sales increasing by 4%, indicating positive momentum across both Victoria's Secret and PINK brands. The company reported a significant improvement in gross margins, which were up 20 basis points year-over-year, driven by reduced reliance on promotions and increased regular price selling. International sales were a standout, growing 22% year-over-year, highlighting the strength of global partnerships and brand relevance. The launch of the Body by Victoria Collection was successful, resulting in double-digit new customer growth and increased engagement.\n\nNegative Points\n\nThe company faced a digital outage in May, which negatively impacted net sales by approximately $20 million during the quarter. Despite improvements, North America bra sales were down low single digits, indicating ongoing challenges in this category. The company is facing increased tariff pressures, with a projected net tariff impact of approximately $100 million for fiscal year 2025. Adjusted operating income guidance remains unchanged due to incremental tariff exposure, despite strong business momentum. The company anticipates a third-quarter adjusted operating loss, reflecting ongoing challenges and macroeconomic uncertainties.\n\nQ & A Highlights\n\nQ: How does the end of the de minimis exemption impact Victoria's Secret & Co? A: Scott Sekella, CFO, stated that the de minimis exemption is not a significant factor for Victoria's Secret & Co as their e-commerce distribution centers are primarily located in Columbus, thus having minimal impact on the business.\n\nStory Continues\n\nQ: Can you elaborate on the innovation strategy for the back half of the year and into 2026, especially considering tariffs? A: Hillary Super, CEO, emphasized a focus on both fashion and technical innovation, particularly in bras and sports. The company is adopting a more frequent release schedule to address customer needs and maintain excitement. This approach will continue into 2026, with a focus on cultural connections and collaborations in the PINK brand.\n\nQ: What is the strategy for gross margins and store traffic with the Store of the Future concept? A: Scott Sekella, CFO, explained that the company is reducing traditional promotions and focusing on regular price sales to mitigate tariff impacts. The Store of the Future remodels have shown double-digit sales lifts, driven by increased traffic and better assortments.\n\nQ: How is the international business performing, and are there differences in strategy compared to the domestic market? A: Hillary Super, CEO, noted strong performance in international markets, particularly in beauty and intimates. The go-to-market strategy is consistent globally, focusing on customer engagement and messaging similar to North America.\n\nQ: What are the plans for the upcoming fashion show, and how does it impact SG&A investments? A: Hillary Super, CEO, mentioned that details about the fashion show will be revealed through social channels. Scott Sekella, CFO, added that while marketing dollars are flat year-over-year, the company is working on amplifying the fashion show's impact.\n\nFor the complete transcript of the earnings call, please refer to the full earnings call transcript.\n\nView Comments",

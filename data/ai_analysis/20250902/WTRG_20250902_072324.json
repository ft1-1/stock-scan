            "title": "Essential Utilities (WTRG)'s Technical Outlook is Bright After Key Golden Cross",
            "content": "Essential Utilities Inc. (WTRG) is looking like an interesting pick from a technical perspective, as the company reached a key level of support. Recently, WTRG's 50-day simple moving average crossed above its 200-day simple moving average, known as a \"golden cross.\"\n\nConsidered an important signifier for a bullish breakout, a golden cross is a technical chart pattern that's formed when a stock's short-term moving average breaks above a longer-term moving average; the most common crossover involves the 50-day and the 200-day, since bigger time periods tend to form stronger breakouts.\n\nA successful golden cross event has three stages. It first begins when a stock's price on the decline bottoms out. Then, its shorter moving average crosses above its longer moving average, triggering a positive trend reversal. The third and final phase occurs when the stock maintains its upward momentum.\n\nA golden cross is the opposite of a death cross, another technical event that indicates bearish price movement may be on the horizon.\n\nWTRG has rallied 7.8% over the past four weeks, and the company is a #3 (Hold) on the Zacks Rank at the moment. This combination indicates WTRG could be poised for a breakout.\n\nOnce investors consider WTRG's positive earnings outlook for the current quarter, the bullish case only solidifies. No earnings estimate has gone lower in the past two months compared to 3 revisions higher, and the Zacks Consensus Estimate has increased as well.Moving Average Chart for WTRG\n\nInvestors should think about putting WTRGon their watchlist given the ultra-important technical indicator and positive move in earnings estimates.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

            "title": "With EPS Growth And More, Essential Utilities (NYSE:WTRG) Makes An Interesting Case",
            "content": "For beginners, it can seem like a good idea (and an exciting prospect) to buy a company that tells a good story to investors, even if it currently lacks a track record of revenue and profit. Unfortunately, these high risk investments often have little probability of ever paying off, and many investors pay a price to learn their lesson. Loss making companies can act like a sponge for capital - so investors should be cautious that they're not throwing good money after bad.\n\nIf this kind of company isn't your style, you like companies that generate revenue, and even earn profits, then you may well be interested in Essential Utilities (NYSE:WTRG). Even if this company is fairly valued by the market, investors would agree that generating consistent profits will continue to provide Essential Utilities with the means to add long-term value to shareholders.\n\nAI is about to change healthcare. These 20 stocks are working on everything from early diagnostics to drug discovery. The best part - they are all under $10bn in marketcap - there is still time to get in early.\n\nEssential Utilities' Earnings Per Share Are Growing\n\nGenerally, companies experiencing growth in earnings per share (EPS) should see similar trends in share price. That makes EPS growth an attractive quality for any company. Essential Utilities managed to grow EPS by 10% per year, over three years. That's a pretty good rate, if the company can sustain it.\n\nTop-line growth is a great indicator that growth is sustainable, and combined with a high earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT) margin, it's a great way for a company to maintain a competitive advantage in the market. The music to the ears of Essential Utilities shareholders is that EBIT margins have grown from 36% to 38% in the last 12 months and revenues are on an upwards trend as well. That's great to see, on both counts.\n\nYou can take a look at the company's revenue and earnings growth trend, in the chart below. To see the actual numbers, click on the chart.NYSE:WTRG Earnings and Revenue History August 28th 2025\n\nSee our latest analysis for Essential Utilities\n\nOf course the knack is to find stocks that have their best days in the future, not in the past. You could base your opinion on past performance, of course, but you may also want to check this interactive graph of professional analyst EPS forecasts for Essential Utilities.\n\nAre Essential Utilities Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?\n\nOwing to the size of Essential Utilities, we wouldn't expect insiders to hold a significant proportion of the company. But we do take comfort from the fact that they are investors in the company. To be specific, they have US$25m worth of shares. This considerable investment should help drive long-term value in the business. Despite being just 0.2% of the company, the value of that investment is enough to show insiders have plenty riding on the venture.\n\nStory Continues\n\nIt's good to see that insiders are invested in the company, but are remuneration levels reasonable? Our quick analysis into CEO remuneration would seem to indicate they are. The median total compensation for CEOs of companies similar in size to Essential Utilities, with market caps over US$8.0b, is around US$14m.\n\nEssential Utilities' CEO took home a total compensation package of US$6.2m in the year prior to December 2024. That looks like a modest pay packet, and may hint at a certain respect for the interests of shareholders. CEO remuneration levels are not the most important metric for investors, but when the pay is modest, that does support enhanced alignment between the CEO and the ordinary shareholders. Generally, arguments can be made that reasonable pay levels attest to good decision-making.\n\nShould You Add Essential Utilities To Your Watchlist?\n\nOne positive for Essential Utilities is that it is growing EPS. That's nice to see. The growth of EPS may be the eye-catching headline for Essential Utilities, but there's more to bring joy for shareholders. Boasting both modest CEO pay and considerable insider ownership, you'd argue this one is worthy of the watchlist, at least. Don't forget that there may still be risks. For instance, we've identified  2 warning signs for Essential Utilities (1 is significant)  you should be aware of.\n\nThere's always the possibility of doing well buying stocks that are not growing earnings and do not have insiders buying shares. But for those who consider these important metrics, we encourage you to check out companies that do have those features. You can access a tailored list of companies which have demonstrated growth backed by significant insider holdings.\n\nPlease note the insider transactions discussed in this article refer to reportable transactions in the relevant jurisdiction.\n\nHave feedback on this article?

            "content": "This story was originally published on Utility Dive. To receive daily news and insights, subscribe to our free daily Utility Dive newsletter.\n\nDive Brief:\n\nInternational Electric Power is planning to develop a 944-MW behind-the-meter, gas-fired plant to power a data center being developed in Greene County, Pennsylvania, according to a project partner’s Wednesday announcement. The data center will be “supplemented by battery storage and back up from an existing interconnection with the electric grid,” the companies said. IEP is a privately held thermal and renewable power developer. Essential Utilities, a publicly-held company, informed the Securities and Exchange Commission it would be investing $26 million in the project to develop a water treatment facility for the power plant and data center. Greene County Chairman Jared Edgreen told Utility Dive the county is aware of the project and sees it as “a large step forward. ... We need to diversify what we have in the county,” he said. “Energy is at a premium.”\n\nDive Insight:\n\nIEP is “proposing a pretty big complex,” Green County administrator Jeffrey Marshall said. He added that a lot of data centers are looking at behind-the-meter generation “versus going through the whole PJM process.”\n\nMost of the approvals needed for the new plant will be handled at the state and federal level, Marshall said.\n\nThe Federal Energy Regulatory Commission in February launched a review of issues related to colocating large loads, such as data centers, at power plants in PJM’s footprint. That review is ongoing.\n\nMeanwhile PJM has also launched a fast-track stakeholder process to develop rules for interconnecting data centers.\n\nThe announcement Wednesday focused on Essential’s investment, as well as its subsidiaries’ involvement.\n\nEssential subsidiary Peoples is the the largest gas utility in Pennsylvania and will provide gas consulting services and energy management services to the project, the company said. Through its subsidiary Aqua, the company will build and operate a water treatment plant to service the power plant and data center, using the adjacent Monongahela River.\n\nThe partnership allows Essential to “leverage our expertise both in water and natural gas and highlights our capabilities as we work with hyperscalers to facilitate the growth of data centers,” Essential CEO and Chairman Chris Franklin said in a statement.\n\nIn another SEC filing, Essential said it has entered into agreements with IEP Hummingbird Energy LLC and International Electric Power III.\n\nStory Continues\n\nIEP, in the announcement with Essential, said it “found that the Greene County site has ample land for the data center and on-site energy generation, has plentiful access to water thanks to its location on the Monongahela River, and boasts dark fiber local to the site.”\n\nAccording to the companies, their partnership “has secured the manufacturing slots” for the combined cycle gas turbines, with delivery expected in 2028. “With the initial funding and the gas turbines secured, IEP is now actively seeking investors for the next stage of the project,” they said.\n\n“Essential’s unique expertise in water, wastewater, and natural gas makes them an ideal partner to ensure we have the power and water needed to bring this data center to life,” IEP CEO Peter Dailey said in a statement.\n\nThe Greene County project is expected to be operational in the first quarter of 2029, the companies said.\n\nRecommended Reading\n\nUtilities need to plan for flexibility, confirm data centers when forecasting load: report\n\nView Comments",

            "content": "To build ~18 million gallon per day (MGD) water treatment plant Water plant to serve on-site power plant and data center Essential to Provide natural gas consultive services and energy management services to the project\n\nBRYN MAWR, Pa., August 27, 2025--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Essential Utilities (NYSE: WTRG) today announced an agreement with International Electric Power III, LLC (IEP), to become an investor in a 1,400 acre, data center facility in Greene County, Pennsylvania.\n\nBased on the agreement, Essential Utilities, through its subsidiary Aqua, plans to design, build, and operate an 18 million gallons per day (MGD) water treatment plant to service the power plant and data center. Using raw water from the adjacent Monongahela River, the water plant will support both power generation and data center cooling needs, leveraging Essential’s deep expertise in water infrastructure and environmental stewardship. In addition, Essential’s subsidiary Peoples, the largest natural gas utility in Pennsylvania, will provide gas consulting services and energy management services to the project.\n\nThe data center will be powered by 944 MW of behind-the-meter, natural gas combined cycle combustion turbines (CCGTs), supplemented by battery storage, and backed up from an existing interconnection with the electric grid.\n\n\"This is an exciting partnership that provides us the opportunity to leverage our expertise both in water and natural gas and highlights our capabilities as we work with hyperscalers to facilitate the growth of data centers to power the new age of Artificial Intelligence, here in Pennsylvania,\" said Chris Franklin, Essential Utilities Chairman and CEO. \"This project aligns perfectly with the Energy and Innovation Summit recently hosted, in Pittsburgh, by U.S. Senator Dave McCormick to encourage investment in Energy and Artificial Intelligence. Pennsylvania has the right business climate for projects like this which is why we are so confident in its success.\"\n\nIEP, the project developer, and a seasoned independent power producer with over 7 GW of generation experience, found that the Greene County site has ample land for the data center and on-site energy generation, has plentiful access to water thanks to its location on the Monongahela River, and boasts dark fiber local to the site.\n\n\"Pennsylvania’s abundant natural resources, world-class workforce and strong federal, state, and local official support drew us to Greene County, and Essential’s investment allows us to take the next step toward making this exciting project a reality for Pennsylvania,\" said IEP CEO Peter Dailey. \"Essential’s unique expertise in water, wastewater, and natural gas makes them an ideal partner to ensure we have the power and water needed to bring this data center to life.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nEssential and IEP’s partnership has secured the manufacturing slots for the gas turbines, with delivery in 2028. With the initial funding and the gas turbines secured, IEP is now actively seeking investors for the next stage of the project.\n\nEssential previously informed investors that the company was in active discussions with data center developers representing over 5 gigawatts of power demand. In addition to the Greene County project, other discussions throughout Essential’s footprint continue to progress, allowing the company to leverage its expertise in both gas and water.\n\nThe Greene County project, expected to be operational in the first quarter of 2029, underscores Essential’s commitment to innovation, sustainability, and regional economic development, while positioning the company’s water, wastewater, and gas expertise as a critical component of the AI-driven data infrastructure revolution.\n\nAbout Essential\n\nEssential Utilities, Inc.

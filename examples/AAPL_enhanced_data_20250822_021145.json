      "content": "Investing.com--\u00a0Oil prices fell slightly in Asian trade on Friday, amid sustained risk-aversion before more cues on U.S. monetary policy from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell at the Jackson Hole Symposium.\n\nBut oil prices were headed for weekly gains, amid increasing signs that peace negotiations between Russia and Ukraine were stalling, heralding more supply risks.\n\nSigns of strong U.S. oil demand, following a bigger-than-expected draw in inventories, also aided oil prices.\n\nBrent Oil Futures fell 0.2% to $67.51 a barrel, while West Texas Intermediate crude futures fell 0.3% to $62.95 a barrel by 21:20 ET (01:20 GMT).\n\nOil heads for weekly gain as Russia-Ukraine peace appears distant\n\nBrent and WTI futures were trading up between 1.5% and 3% this week, after largely recouping losses made at the beginning of the week.\n\nWhile oil prices had tumbled amid increased efforts by the U.S. to broker a Russia-Ukraine peace treaty over the past week, traders were seen growing increasingly convinced that a deal will not be signed in the near-term. President Donald Trump met Russian President Vladimir Putin, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, and a host of European leaders.\n\nBut the meetings did not appear to have yielded any conclusive results on the war, with markets left wanting on several details\u2013 including the timing of Russia-Ukraine talks, and the nature of U.S. and European security guarantees made to Ukraine.\n\nRussia and Ukraine both blamed each other for stalling the peace process, while also keeping up military offensives against each other. Russia was seen launching a major air attack on Ukraine on Thursday, after Kyiv claimed to have hit an oil refinery.\n\nUncertainty over an end to the war also presented the potential for tighter U.S. sanctions on Russian oil. Trump recently outlined 50% tariffs against India over its purchase of Russian crude.\n\nUS demand cues support oil; Jackson Hole awaited\n\nOil\u2019s gains this week also came amid some optimism that demand in the U.S., the world\u2019s biggest fuel consumer, remained robust.\n\nU.S. inventories saw a much bigger than expected 6 million barrel draw in the week to August 15, data showed earlier this week.\n\nPurchasing managers index data for August showed improvements in both manufacturing and services activity, indicating that business activity in the country remained robust.\n\nFocus is now squarely on Fed Chair Jerome Powell\u2019s address at the Jackson Hole Symposium on Friday, for more cues on interest rates and the economy.\n\nWaning expectations that the Fed will cut rates in September put some pressure on oil prices this week, especially as the dollar firmed.",

      "content": "(Reuters) -Oil prices were little changed on Friday but were on track to snap a two-week losing streak as hope for immediate peace between Russia and Ukraine dimmed, increasing the risk premium demanded by oil sellers.\n\nBrent crude futures were down 4 cents to $67.63 a barrel at 0052 GMT, while West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures fell 1 cent to $63.51.\n\nBoth contracts climbed more than 1% in the prior session. Brent has risen 2.7% this week, while the WTI has gained 1.1%.\n\nTraders are pricing in more risk as hope that U.S. President Donald Trump can quickly broker a deal to end the war, which propelled a sell-off in oil over the last two weeks, fades.\n\nThe three-and-a-half-year war continued unabated on Thursday as Russia launched an air attack near Ukraine\u2019s border with the European Union and Ukraine said it hit a Russian oil refinery.\n\nMeanwhile, U.S. and European planners said they have developed military options by allied national security advisers.\n\nThat followed the first in-person talks at the weekend between the U.S. and Russian leaders since Russia invaded Ukraine, which have so far yielded little progress toward peace.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin demanded Ukraine give up all of the eastern Donbas region, renounce NATO ambitions and keep Western troops out of the country, sources told Reuters.\n\nTrump pledged to protect Ukraine under any war-ending deal.\n\nUkraine President Volodymyr Zelenskiy dismissed the idea of withdrawing from internationally recognised Ukrainian land.\n\nOil prices were also supported by a larger-than-expected drawdown from U.S. crude stockpiles in the last week, indicating strong demand.\n\nStockpiles fell 6 million barrels in the week ended August 15, the U.S. Energy Information Administration said on Wednesday. Analysts had expected 1.8 million barrels. [EIA/S]\n\nInvestors were also looking to the Jackson Hole economic conference in Wyoming for signals of a Federal Reserve interest rate cut next month. The annual gathering of central bankers begins on Thursday, with Fed Chair Jerome Powell speaking on Friday.\n\nLower interest rates can stimulate economic growth and increase oil demand, potentially boosting prices.",

Ceramic tiles are crafted from a blend of raw materials, typically including clay, feldspar, sand, and talc. These materials are shaped and fired in a kiln. It includes a process that removes all moisture and creates a hard and durable surface finish. If the tile design includes a glaze, it is applied to the tile's surface before the kiln firing. During firing, the glaze hardens into an almost glass-like finish, serving both as a decorative feature and as a protective layer against moisture and dirt.\n\nDownload PDF Brochure: https://www.marketsandmarkets.com/pdfdownloadNew.asp?id=228236779\n\nBrowse in-depth TOC on\u00a0\u201cCeramic Tile Market\u201d\n\n292 - Market Data Tables\r\n58 \u2013 Figures\r\n272 - Pages\n\nList of Key Players in Ceramic Tiles Market:\n\nMohawk      Industries Inc.

The floor tiles are influenced by size and durability, while wall tiles are more dependent on aesthetic appeal.\n\nThe ceramic tiles market is categorized, by end-use sector into residential and non-residential sectors. The largest share in the ceramic tiles market, in terms of value, is held by the residential segment. The choice of materials differs significantly between commercial and residential construction.
